       "['Twilight of a certain summer day, many years ago, shaded softly down\\r over the wild Ohio valley bringing keen anxiety to a traveler on the\\r lonely river trail. He had expected to reach Fort Henry with his party\\r on this night, thus putting a welcome end to the long, rough,\\r hazardous journey through the wilderness; but the swift, on-coming\\r dusk made it imperative to halt. The narrow, forest-skirted trail,\\r difficult to follow in broad daylight, apparently led into gloomy\\r aisles in the woods. His guide had abandoned him that morning, making\\r excuse that his services were no longer needed; his teamster was new\\r to the frontier, and, altogether, the situation caused him much\\r uneasiness.',\n",
       " '\"I wouldn\\'t so much mind another night in camp, if the guide had not\\r left us,\" he said in a low tone to the teamster.',\n",
       " 'That worthy shook his shaggy head, and growled while he began\\r unhitching the horses.',\n",
       " '\"Uncle,\" said a young man, who had clambered out from the wagon, \"we\\r must be within a few miles of Fort Henry.\"',\n",
       " '\"How d\\'ye know we\\'re near the fort?\" interrupted the teamster, \"or\\r safe, either, fer thet matter? I don\\'t know this country.\"',\n",
       " '\"The guide assured me we could easily make Fort Henry by sundown.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thet guide! I tell ye, Mr. Sheppard----\"',\n",
       " '\"Not so loud. Do not alarm my daughter,\" cautioned the man who had\\r been called Sheppard.',\n",
       " '\"Did ye notice anythin\\' queer about thet guide?\" asked the teamster,\\r lowering his voice. \"Did ye see how oneasy he was last night? Did it\\r strike ye he left us in a hurry, kind of excited like, in spite of his\\r offhand manner?\"',\n",
       " '\"Yes, he acted odd, or so it seemed to me,\" replied Sheppard. \"How\\r about you, Will?\"',\n",
       " '\"Now that I think of it, I believe he was queer. He behaved like a man\\r who expected somebody, or feared something might happen. I fancied,\\r however, that it was simply the manner of a woodsman.\"',\n",
       " '\"Wal, I hev my opinion,\" said the teamster, in a gruff whisper. \"Ye\\r was in a hurry to be a-goin\\', an\\' wouldn\\'t take no advice. The\\r fur-trader at Fort Pitt didn\\'t give this guide Jenks no good send off.\\r Said he wasn\\'t well-known round Pitt, \\'cept he could handle a\\r knife some.\"',\n",
       " '\"What is your opinion?\" asked Sheppard, as the teamster paused.',\n",
       " '\"Wal, the valley below Pitt is full of renegades, outlaws an\\'\\r hoss-thieves. The redskins ain\\'t so bad as they used to be, but these\\r white fellers are wusser\\'n ever. This guide Jenks might be in with\\r them, that\\'s all. Mebbe I\\'m wrong. I hope so. The way he left us\\r looks bad.\"',\n",
       " '\"We won\\'t borrow trouble. If we have come all this way without seeing\\r either Indian or outlaw--in fact, without incident--I feel certain we\\r can perform the remainder of the journey in safety.\" Then Mr. Sheppard\\r raised his voice. \"Here, Helen, you lazy girl, come out of that wagon.\\r We want some supper. Will, you gather some firewood, and we\\'ll soon\\r give this gloomy little glen a more cheerful aspect.\"',\n",
       " 'As Mr. Sheppard turned toward the canvas-covered wagon a girl leaped\\r lightly down beside him. She was nearly as tall as he.',\n",
       " '\"Is this Fort Henry?\" she asked, cheerily, beginning to dance around\\r him. \"Where\\'s the inn? I\\'m _so_ hungry. How glad I am to get out of\\r that wagon! I\\'d like to run. Isn\\'t this a lonesome, lovely spot?\"',\n",
       " 'A camp-fire soon crackled with hiss and sputter, and fragrant\\r wood-smoke filled the air. Steaming kettle, and savory steaks of\\r venison cheered the hungry travelers, making them forget for the time\\r the desertion of their guide and the fact that they might be lost. The\\r last glow faded entirely out of the western sky. Night enveloped the\\r forest, and the little glade was a bright spot in the gloom.',\n",
       " 'The flickering light showed Mr. Sheppard to be a well-preserved old\\r man with gray hair and ruddy, kindly face. The nephew had a boyish,\\r frank expression. The girl was a splendid specimen of womanhood. Her\\r large, laughing eyes were as dark as the shadows beneath the trees.',\n",
       " \"Suddenly a quick start on Helen's part interrupted the merry flow of\\r conversation. She sat bolt upright with half-averted face.\",\n",
       " '\"Cousin, what is the matter?\" asked Will, quickly.',\n",
       " 'Helen remained motionless.',\n",
       " '\"My dear,\" said Mr. Sheppard sharply.',\n",
       " '\"I heard a footstep,\" she whispered, pointing with trembling finger\\r toward the impenetrable blackness beyond the camp-fire.',\n",
       " 'All could hear a soft patter on the leaves. Then distinct footfalls\\r broke the silence.',\n",
       " 'The tired teamster raised his shaggy head and glanced fearfully around\\r the glade. Mr. Sheppard and Will gazed doubtfully toward the foliage;\\r but Helen did not change her position. The travelers appeared stricken\\r by the silence and solitude of the place. The faint hum of insects,\\r and the low moan of the night wind, seemed accentuated by the almost\\r painful stillness.',\n",
       " '\"A panther, most likely,\" suggested Sheppard, in a voice which he\\r intended should be reassuring. \"I saw one to-day slinking along\\r the trail.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'d better get my gun from the wagon,\" said Will.',\n",
       " '\"How dark and wild it is here!\" exclaimed Helen nervously. \"I believe\\r I was frightened. Perhaps I fancied it--there! Again--listen. Ah!\"',\n",
       " 'Two tall figures emerged from the darkness into the circle of light,\\r and with swift, supple steps gained the camp-fire before any of the\\r travelers had time to move. They were Indians, and the brandishing of\\r their tomahawks proclaimed that they were hostile.',\n",
       " '\"Ugh!\" grunted the taller savage, as he looked down upon the\\r defenseless, frightened group.',\n",
       " 'As the menacing figures stood in the glare of the fire gazing at the\\r party with shifty eyes, they presented a frightful appearance. Fierce\\r lineaments, all the more so because of bars of paint, the hideous,\\r shaven heads adorned with tufts of hair holding a single feather,\\r sinewy, copper-colored limbs suggestive of action and endurance, the\\r general aspect of untamed ferocity, appalled the travelers and chilled\\r their blood.',\n",
       " 'Grunts and chuckles manifested the satisfaction with which the Indians\\r fell upon the half-finished supper. They caused it to vanish with\\r astonishing celerity, and resembled wolves rather than human beings in\\r their greediness.',\n",
       " 'Helen looked timidly around as if hoping to see those who would aid,\\r and the savages regarded her with ill humor. A movement on the part of\\r any member of the group caused muscular hands to steal toward the\\r tomahawks.',\n",
       " \"Suddenly the larger savage clutched his companion's knee. Then lifting\\r his hatchet, shook it with a significant gesture in Sheppard's face,\\r at the same time putting a finger on his lips to enjoin silence. Both\\r Indians became statuesque in their immobility. They crouched in an\\r attitude of listening, with heads bent on one side, nostrils dilated,\\r and mouths open.\",\n",
       " 'One, two, three moments passed. The silence of the forest appeared to\\r be unbroken; but ears as keen as those of a deer had detected some\\r sound. The larger savage dropped noiselessly to the ground, where he\\r lay stretched out with his ear to the ground. The other remained\\r immovable; only his beady eyes gave signs of life, and these covered\\r every point.',\n",
       " 'Finally the big savage rose silently, pointed down the dark trail, and\\r strode out of the circle of light. His companion followed close at his\\r heels. The two disappeared in the black shadows like specters, as\\r silently as they had come.',\n",
       " '\"Well!\" breathed Helen.',\n",
       " '\"I am immensely relieved!\" exclaimed Will.',\n",
       " '\"What do you make of such strange behavior?\" Sheppard asked of the\\r teamster.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'spect they got wind of somebody; most likely thet guide, an\\'ll be\\r back again. If they ain\\'t, it\\'s because they got switched off by some\\r signs or tokens, skeered, perhaps, by the scent of the wind.\"',\n",
       " 'Hardly had he ceased speaking when again the circle of light was\\r invaded by stalking forms.',\n",
       " '\"I thought so! Here comes the skulkin\\' varmints,\" whispered the\\r teamster.',\n",
       " 'But he was wrong. A deep, calm voice spoke the single word: \"Friends.\"',\n",
       " 'Two men in the brown garb of woodsmen approached. One approached the\\r travelers; the other remained in the background, leaning upon a long,\\r black rifle.',\n",
       " 'Thus exposed to the glare of the flames, the foremost woodsman\\r presented a singularly picturesque figure. His costume was the fringed\\r buckskins of the border. Fully six feet tall, this lithe-limbed young\\r giant had something of the wild, free grace of the Indian in\\r his posture.',\n",
       " 'He surveyed the wondering travelers with dark, grave eyes.',\n",
       " '\"Did the reddys do any mischief?\" he asked.',\n",
       " '\"No, they didn\\'t harm us,\" replied Sheppard. \"They ate our supper,\\r and slipped off into the woods without so much as touching one of us.\\r But, indeed, sir, we are mighty glad to see you.\"',\n",
       " \"Will echoed this sentiment, and Helen's big eyes were fastened upon\\r the stranger in welcome and wonder.\",\n",
       " '\"We saw your fire blazin\\' through the twilight, an\\' came up just in\\r time to see the Injuns make off.\"',\n",
       " '\"Might they not hide in the bushes and shoot us?\" asked Will, who had\\r listened to many a border story at Fort Pitt. \"It seems as if we\\'d\\r make good targets in this light.\"',\n",
       " \"The gravity of the woodsman's face relaxed.\",\n",
       " '\"You will pursue them?\" asked Helen.',\n",
       " '\"They\\'ve melted into the night-shadows long ago,\" he replied. \"Who was\\r your guide?\"',\n",
       " '\"I hired him at Fort Pitt. He left us suddenly this morning. A big\\r man, with black beard and bushy eyebrows. A bit of his ear had been\\r shot or cut out,\" Sheppard replied.',\n",
       " '\"Jenks, one of Bing Legget\\'s border-hawks.\"',\n",
       " '\"You have his name right. And who may Bing Legget be?\"',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s an outlaw. Jenks has been tryin\\' to lead you into a trap. Likely\\r he expected those Injuns to show up a day or two ago. Somethin\\' went\\r wrong with the plan, I reckon. Mebbe he was waitin\\' for five Shawnees,\\r an\\' mebbe he\\'ll never see three of \\'em again.\"',\n",
       " 'Something suggestive, cold, and grim, in the last words did not escape\\r the listeners.',\n",
       " '\"How far are we from Fort Henry?\" asked Sheppard.',\n",
       " '\"Eighteen miles as a crow flies; longer by trail.\"',\n",
       " '\"Treachery!\" exclaimed the old man. \"We were no more than that this\\r morning. It is indeed fortunate that you found us. I take it you are\\r from Fort Henry, and will guide us there? I am an old friend of\\r Colonel Zane\\'s. He will appreciate any kindness you may show us. Of\\r course you know him?\"',\n",
       " '\"I am Jonathan Zane.\"',\n",
       " \"Sheppard suddenly realized that he was facing the most celebrated\\r scout on the border. In Revolutionary times Zane's fame had extended\\r even to the far Atlantic Colonies.\",\n",
       " '\"And your companion?\" asked Sheppard with keen interest. He guessed\\r what might be told. Border lore coupled Jonathan Zane with a strange\\r and terrible character, a border Nemesis, a mysterious, shadowy,\\r elusive man, whom few pioneers ever saw, but of whom all knew.',\n",
       " '\"Wetzel,\" answered Zane.',\n",
       " \"With one accord the travelers gazed curiously at Zane's silent\\r companion. In the dim background of the glow cast by the fire, he\\r stood a gigantic figure, dark, quiet, and yet with something\\r intangible in his shadowy outline.\",\n",
       " 'Suddenly he appeared to merge into the gloom as if he really were a\\r phantom. A warning, \"Hist!\" came from the bushes.',\n",
       " 'With one swift kick Zane scattered the camp-fire.',\n",
       " 'The travelers waited with bated breaths. They could hear nothing save\\r the beating of their own hearts; they could not even see each other.',\n",
       " '\"Better go to sleep,\" came in Zane\\'s calm voice. What a relief it was!\\r \"We\\'ll keep watch, an\\' at daybreak guide you to Fort Henry.\"',\n",
       " \"Colonel Zane, a rugged, stalwart pioneer, with a strong, dark face,\\r sat listening to his old friend's dramatic story. At its close a\\r genial smile twinkled in his fine dark eyes.\",\n",
       " '\"Well, well, Sheppard, no doubt it was a thrilling adventure to you,\"\\r he said. \"It might have been a little more interesting, and doubtless\\r would, had I not sent Wetzel and Jonathan to look you up.\"',\n",
       " '\"You did? How on earth did you know I was on the border? I counted\\r much on the surprise I should give you.\"',\n",
       " '\"My Indian runners leave Fort Pitt ahead of any travelers, and\\r acquaint me with particulars.\"',\n",
       " '\"I remembered a fleet-looking Indian who seemed to be asking for\\r information about us, when we arrived at Fort Pitt. I am sorry I did\\r not take the fur-trader\\'s advice in regard to the guide. But I was in\\r such a hurry to come, and didn\\'t feel able to bear the expense of a\\r raft or boat that we might come by river. My nephew brought\\r considerable gold, and I all my earthly possessions.\"',\n",
       " '\"All\\'s well that ends well,\" replied Colonel Zane cheerily. \"But we\\r must thank Providence that Wetzel and Jonathan came up in the nick\\r of time.\"',\n",
       " '\"Indeed, yes. I\\'m not likely to forget those fierce savages. How they\\r slipped off into the darkness! I wonder if Wetzel pursued them? He\\r disappeared last night, and we did not see him again. In fact we\\r hardly had a fair look at him. I question if I should recognize him\\r now, unless by his great stature.\"',\n",
       " '\"He was ahead of Jonathan on the trail. That is Wetzel\\'s way. In times\\r of danger he is seldom seen, yet is always near. But come, let us go\\r out and look around. I am running up a log cabin which will come in\\r handy for you.\"',\n",
       " 'They passed out into the shade of pine and maples. A winding path led\\r down a gentle slope. On the hillside under a spreading tree a throng\\r of bearded pioneers, clad in faded buckskins and wearing white-ringed\\r coonskin caps, were erecting a log cabin.',\n",
       " '\"Life here on the border is keen, hard, invigorating,\" said Colonel\\r Zane. \"I tell you, George Sheppard, in spite of your gray hair and\\r your pretty daughter, you have come out West because you want to live\\r among men who do things.\"',\n",
       " '\"Colonel, I won\\'t gainsay I\\'ve still got hot blood,\" replied Sheppard;\\r \"but I came to Fort Henry for land. My old home in Williamsburg has\\r fallen into ruin together with the fortunes of my family. I brought my\\r daughter and my nephew because I wanted them to take root in\\r new soil.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, George, right glad we are to have you. Where are your sons? I\\r remember them, though \\'tis sixteen long years since I left old\\r Williamsburg.\"',\n",
       " '\"Gone. The Revolution took my sons. Helen is the last of the family.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, well, indeed that\\'s hard. Independence has cost you colonists\\r as big a price as border-freedom has us pioneers. Come, old friend,\\r forget the past. A new life begins for you here, and it will be one\\r which gives you much. See, up goes a cabin; that will soon be\\r your home.\"',\n",
       " \"Sheppard's eye marked the sturdy pioneers and a fast diminishing pile\\r of white-oak logs.\",\n",
       " '\"Ho-heave!\" cried a brawny foreman.',\n",
       " 'A dozen stout shoulders sagged beneath a well-trimmed log.',\n",
       " '\"Ho-heave!\" yelled the foreman.',\n",
       " '\"See, up she goes,\" cried the colonel, \"and to-morrow night she\\'ll\\r shed rain.\"',\n",
       " 'They walked down a sandy lane bounded on the right by a wide, green\\r clearing, and on the left by a line of chestnuts and maples, outposts\\r of the thick forests beyond.',\n",
       " '\"Yours is a fine site for a house,\" observed Sheppard, taking in the\\r clean-trimmed field that extended up the hillside, a brook that\\r splashed clear and noisy over the stones to tarry in a little\\r grass-bound lake which forced water through half-hollowed logs into a\\r spring house.',\n",
       " '\"I think so; this is the fourth time I\\'ve put up a\\' cabin on this\\r land,\" replied the colonel.',\n",
       " '\"How\\'s that?\"',\n",
       " '\"The redskins are keen to burn things.\"',\n",
       " 'Sheppard laughed at the pioneer\\'s reply. \"It\\'s not difficult, Colonel\\r Zane, to understand why Fort Henry has stood all these years, with you\\r as its leader. Certainly the location for your cabin is the finest in\\r the settlement. What a view!\"',\n",
       " \"High upon a bluff overhanging the majestic, slow-winding Ohio, the\\r colonel's cabin afforded a commanding position from which to view the\\r picturesque valley. Sheppard's eye first caught the outline of the\\r huge, bold, time-blackened fort which frowned protectingly over\\r surrounding log-cabins; then he saw the wide-sweeping river with its\\r verdant islands, golden, sandy bars, and willow-bordered shores, while\\r beyond, rolling pastures of wavy grass merging into green forests that\\r swept upward with slow swell until lost in the dim purple of distant\\r mountains.\",\n",
       " '\"Sixteen years ago I came out of the thicket upon yonder bluff, and\\r saw this valley. I was deeply impressed by its beauty, but more by its\\r wonderful promise.\"',\n",
       " '\"Were you alone?\"',\n",
       " '\"I and my dog. There had been a few white men before me on the river;\\r but I was the first to see this glorious valley from the bluff. Now,\\r George, I\\'ll let you have a hundred acres of well-cleared land. The\\r soil is so rich you can raise two crops in one season. With some\\r stock, and a few good hands, you\\'ll soon be a busy man.\"',\n",
       " '\"I didn\\'t expect so much land; I can\\'t well afford to pay for it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Talk to me of payment when the farm yields an income. Is this young\\r nephew of yours strong and willing?\"',\n",
       " '\"He is, and has gold enough to buy a big farm.\"',\n",
       " '\"Let him keep his money, and make a comfortable home for some good\\r lass. We marry our young people early out here. And your daughter,\\r George, is she fitted for this hard border life?\"',\n",
       " '\"Never fear for Helen.\"',\n",
       " '\"The brunt of this pioneer work falls on our women. God bless them,\\r how heroic they\\'ve been! The life here is rough for a man, let alone a\\r woman. But it is a man\\'s game. We need girls, girls who will bear\\r strong men. Yet I am always saddened when I see one come out on\\r the border.\"',\n",
       " '\"I think I knew what I was bringing Helen to, and she didn\\'t flinch,\"\\r said Sheppard, somewhat surprised at the tone in which the\\r colonel spoke.',\n",
       " '\"No one knows until he has lived on the border. Well, well, all this\\r is discouraging to you. Ah! here is Miss Helen with my sister.\"',\n",
       " \"The colonel's fine, dark face lost its sternness, and brightened with\\r a smile.\",\n",
       " '\"I hope you rested well after your long ride.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am seldom tired, and I have been made most comfortable. I thank you\\r and your sister,\" replied the girl, giving Colonel Zane her hand, and\\r including both him and his sister in her grateful glance.',\n",
       " \"The colonel's sister was a slender, handsome young woman, whose dark\\r beauty showed to most effective advantage by the contrast with her\\r companion's fair skin, golden hair, and blue eyes.\",\n",
       " 'Beautiful as was Helen Sheppard, it was her eyes that held Colonel\\r Zane irresistibly. They were unusually large, of a dark purple-blue\\r that changed, shaded, shadowed with her every thought.',\n",
       " '\"Come, let us walk,\" Colonel Zane said abruptly, and, with Mr.\\r Sheppard, followed the girls down the path. He escorted them to the\\r fort, showed a long room with little squares cut in the rough-hewn\\r logs, many bullet holes, fire-charred timbers, and dark stains,\\r terribly suggestive of the pain and heroism which the defense of that\\r rude structure had cost.',\n",
       " \"Under Helen's eager questioning Colonel Zane yielded to his weakness\\r for story-telling, and recited the history of the last siege of Fort\\r Henry; how the renegade Girty swooped down upon the settlement with\\r hundreds of Indians and British soldiers; how for three days of\\r whistling bullets, flaming arrows, screeching demons, fire, smoke, and\\r attack following attack, the brave defenders stood at their posts,\\r there to die before yielding.\",\n",
       " '\"Grand!\" breathed Helen, and her eyes glowed. \"It was then Betty Zane\\r ran with the powder? Oh! I\\'ve heard the story.\"',\n",
       " '\"Let my sister tell you of that,\" said the colonel, smiling.',\n",
       " '\"You! Was it you?\" And Helen\\'s eyes glowed brighter with the light of\\r youth\\'s glory in great deeds.',\n",
       " '\"My sister has been wedded and widowed since then,\" said Colonel Zane,\\r reading in Helen\\'s earnest scrutiny of his sister\\'s calm, sad face a\\r wonder if this quiet woman could be the fearless and famed\\r Elizabeth Zane.',\n",
       " \"Impulsively Helen's hand closed softly over her companion's. Out of\\r the girlish sympathetic action a warm friendship was born.\",\n",
       " '\"I imagine things do happen here,\" said Mr. Sheppard, hoping to hear\\r more from Colonel Zane.',\n",
       " 'The colonel smiled grimly.',\n",
       " '\"Every summer during fifteen years has been a bloody one on the\\r border. The sieges of Fort Henry, and Crawford\\'s defeat, the biggest\\r things we ever knew out here, are matters of history; of course you\\r are familiar with them. But the numberless Indian forays and attacks,\\r the women who have been carried into captivity by renegades, the\\r murdered farmers, in fact, ceaseless war never long directed at any\\r point, but carried on the entire length of the river, are matters\\r known only to the pioneers. Within five miles of Fort Henry I can show\\r you where the laurel bushes grow three feet high over the ashes of two\\r settlements, and many a clearing where some unfortunate pioneer had\\r staked his claim and thrown up a log cabin, only to die fighting for\\r his wife and children. Between here and Fort Pitt there is only one\\r settlement, Yellow Creek, and most of its inhabitants are survivors of\\r abandoned villages farther up the river. Last summer we had the\\r Moravian Massacre, the blackest, most inhuman deed ever committed.\\r Since then Simon Girty and his bloody redskins have lain low.\"',\n",
       " '\"You must always have had a big force,\" said Sheppard.',\n",
       " '\"We\\'ve managed always to be strong enough, though there never were a\\r large number of men here. During the last siege I had only forty in\\r the fort, counting men, women and boys. But I had pioneers and women\\r who could handle a rifle, and the best bordermen on the frontier.\"',\n",
       " '\"Do you make a distinction between pioneers and bordermen?\" asked\\r Sheppard.',\n",
       " '\"Indeed, yes. I am a pioneer; a borderman is an Indian hunter, or\\r scout. For years my cabins housed Andrew Zane, Sam and John McCollock,\\r Bill Metzar, and John and Martin Wetzel, all of whom are dead. Not one\\r saved his scalp. Fort Henry is growing; it has pioneers, rivermen,\\r soldiers, but only two bordermen. Wetzel and Jonathan are the only\\r ones we have left of those great men.\"',\n",
       " '\"They must be old,\" mused Helen, with a dreamy glow still in her eyes.',\n",
       " '\"Well, Miss Helen, not in years, as you mean. Life here is old in\\r experience; few pioneers, and no bordermen, live to a great age.\\r Wetzel is about forty, and my brother Jonathan still a young man; but\\r both are old in border lore.\"',\n",
       " 'Earnestly, as a man who loves his subject, Colonel Zane told his\\r listeners of these two most prominent characters of the border.\\r Sixteen years previously, when but boys in years, they had cast in\\r their lot with his, and journeyed over the Virginian Mountains, Wetzel\\r to devote his life to the vengeful calling he had chosen, and Jonathan\\r to give rein to an adventurous spirit and love of the wilds. By some\\r wonderful chance, by cunning, woodcraft, or daring, both men had lived\\r through the years of border warfare which had brought to a close the\\r careers of all their contemporaries.',\n",
       " 'For many years Wetzel preferred solitude to companionship; he roamed\\r the wilderness in pursuit of Indians, his life-long foes, and seldom\\r appeared at the settlement except to bring news of an intended raid of\\r the savages. Jonathan also spent much time alone in the woods, or\\r scouting along the river. But of late years a friendship had ripened\\r between the two bordermen. Mutual interest had brought them together\\r on the trail of a noted renegade, and when, after many long days of\\r patient watching and persistent tracking, the outlaw paid an awful\\r penalty for his bloody deeds, these lone and silent men were friends.',\n",
       " \"Powerful in build, fleet as deer, fearless and tireless, Wetzel's\\r peculiar bloodhound sagacity, ferocity, and implacability, balanced by\\r Jonathan's keen intelligence and judgment caused these bordermen to\\r become the bane of redmen and renegades. Their fame increased with\\r each succeeding summer, until now the people of the settlement looked\\r upon wonderful deeds of strength and of woodcraft as a matter of\\r course, rejoicing in the power and skill with which these men\\r were endowed.\",\n",
       " \"By common consent the pioneers attributed any mysterious deed, from\\r the finding of a fat turkey on a cabin doorstep, to the discovery of a\\r savage scalped and pulled from his ambush near a settler's spring, to\\r Wetzel and Jonathan. All the more did they feel sure of this\\r conclusion because the bordermen never spoke of their deeds. Sometimes\\r a pioneer living on the outskirts of the settlement would be awakened\\r in the morning by a single rifle shot, and on peering out would see a\\r dead Indian lying almost across his doorstep, while beyond, in the\\r dim, gray mist, a tall figure stealing away. Often in the twilight on\\r a summer evening, while fondling his children and enjoying his smoke\\r after a hard day's labor in the fields, this same settler would see\\r the tall, dark figure of Jonathan Zane step noiselessly out of a\\r thicket, and learn that he must take his family and flee at once to\\r the fort for safety. When a settler was murdered, his children carried\\r into captivity by Indians, and the wife given over to the power of\\r some brutal renegade, tragedies wofully frequent on the border, Wetzel\\r and Jonathan took the trail alone. Many a white woman was returned\\r alive and, sometimes, unharmed to her relatives; more than one maiden\\r lived to be captured, rescued, and returned to her lover, while almost\\r numberless were the bones of brutal redmen lying in the deep and\\r gloomy woods, or bleaching on the plains, silent, ghastly reminders of\\r the stern justice meted out by these two heroes.\",\n",
       " '\"Such are my two bordermen, Miss Sheppard. The fort there, and all\\r these cabins, would be only black ashes, save for them, and as for us,\\r our wives and children--God only knows.\"',\n",
       " '\"Haven\\'t they wives and children, too?\" asked Helen.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" answered Colonel Zane, with his genial smile. \"Such joys are not\\r for bordermen.\"',\n",
       " '\"Why not? Fine men like them deserve happiness,\" declared Helen.',\n",
       " '\"It is necessary we have such,\" said the colonel simply, \"and they\\r cannot be bordermen unless free as the air blows. Wetzel and Jonathan\\r have never had sweethearts. I believe Wetzel loved a lass once; but he\\r was an Indian-killer whose hands were red with blood. He silenced his\\r heart, and kept to his chosen, lonely life. Jonathan does not seem to\\r realize that women exist to charm, to please, to be loved and married.\\r Once we twitted him about his brothers doing their duty by the border,\\r whereupon he flashed out: \\'My life is the border\\'s: my sweetheart is\\r the North Star!\\'\"',\n",
       " \"Helen dreamily watched the dancing, dimpling waves that broke on the\\r stones of the river shore. All unconscious of the powerful impression\\r the colonel's recital had made upon her, she was feeling the greatness\\r of the lives of these bordermen, and the glory it would now be for her\\r to share with others the pride in their protection.\",\n",
       " '\"Say, Sheppard, look here,\" said Colonel Zane, on the return to his\\r cabin, \"that girl of yours has a pair of eyes. I can\\'t forget the way\\r they flashed! They\\'ll cause more trouble here among my garrison than\\r would a swarm of redskins.\"',\n",
       " '\"No! You don\\'t mean it! Out here in this wilderness?\" queried Sheppard\\r doubtfully.',\n",
       " '\"Well, I do.\"',\n",
       " '\"O Lord! What a time I\\'ve had with that girl! There was one man\\r especially, back home, who made our lives miserable. He was rich and\\r well born; but Helen would have none of him. He got around me, old\\r fool that I am! Practically stole what was left of my estate, and\\r gambled it away when Helen said she\\'d die before giving herself to\\r him. It was partly on his account that I brought her away. Then there\\r were a lot of moon-eyed beggars after her all the time, and she\\'s\\r young and full of fire. I hoped I\\'d marry her to some farmer out here,\\r and end my days in peace.\"',\n",
       " '\"Peace? With eyes like those? Never on this green earth,\" and Colonel\\r Zane laughed as he slapped his friend on the shoulder. \"Don\\'t worry,\\r old fellow. You can\\'t help her having those changing dark-blue eyes\\r any more than you can help being proud of them. They have won me,\\r already, susceptible old backwoodsman! I\\'ll help you with this\\r spirited young lady. I\\'ve had experience, Sheppard, and don\\'t you\\r forget it. First, my sister, a Zane all through, which is saying\\r enough. Then as sweet and fiery a little Indian princess as ever\\r stepped in a beaded moccasin, and since, more than one beautiful,\\r impulsive creature. Being in authority, I suppose it\\'s natural that\\r all the work, from keeping the garrison ready against an attack, to\\r straightening out love affairs, should fall upon me. I\\'ll take the\\r care off your shoulders; I\\'ll keep these young dare-devils from\\r killing each other over Miss Helen\\'s favors. I certainly--Hello! There\\r are strangers at the gate. Something\\'s up.\"',\n",
       " 'Half a dozen rough-looking men had appeared from round the corner of\\r the cabin, and halted at the gate.',\n",
       " '\"Bill Elsing, and some of his men from Yellow Creek,\" said Colonel\\r Zane, as he went toward the group.',\n",
       " '\"Hullo, Kurnel,\" was the greeting of the foremost, evidently the\\r leader. \"We\\'ve lost six head of hosses over our way, an\\' are out\\r lookin\\' \\'em up.\"',\n",
       " '\"The deuce you have! Say, this horse-stealing business is getting\\r interesting. What did you come in for?\"',\n",
       " '\"Wal, we meets Jonathan on the ridge about sunup, an\\' he sent us back\\r lickety-cut. Said he had two of the hosses corralled, an\\' mebbe Wetzel\\r could git the others.\"',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s strange,\" replied Colonel Zane thoughtfully.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Pears to me Jack and Wetzel hev some redskins treed, an\\' didn\\'t want\\r us to spile the fun. Mebbe there wasn\\'t scalps enough to go round.\\r Anyway, we come in, an\\' we\\'ll hang up here to-day.\"',\n",
       " '\"Bill, who\\'s doing this horse-stealing?\"',\n",
       " '\"Damn if I know. It\\'s a mighty pert piece of work. I\\'ve a mind it\\'s\\r some slick white fellar, with Injuns backin\\' him.\"',\n",
       " \"Helen noted, when she was once more indoors, that Colonel Zane's wife\\r appeared worried. Her usual placid expression was gone. She put off\\r the playful overtures of her two bright boys with unusual\\r indifference, and turned to her husband with anxious questioning as to\\r whether the strangers brought news of Indians. Upon being assured that\\r such was not the case, she looked relieved, and explained to Helen\\r that she had seen armed men come so often to consult the colonel\\r regarding dangerous missions and expeditions, that the sight of a\\r stranger caused her unspeakable dread.\",\n",
       " '\"I am accustomed to danger, yet I can never control my fears for my\\r husband and children,\" said Mrs. Zane. \"The older I grow the more of a\\r coward I am. Oh! this border life is sad for women. Only a little\\r while ago my brother Samuel McColloch was shot and scalped right here\\r on the river bank. He was going to the spring for a bucket of water. I\\r lost another brother in almost the same way. Every day during the\\r summer a husband and a father fall victim to some murderous Indian. My\\r husband will go in the same way some day. The border claims them all.\"',\n",
       " '\"Bessie, you must not show your fears to our new friend. And, Miss\\r Helen, don\\'t believe she\\'s the coward she would make out,\" said the\\r colonel\\'s sister smilingly.',\n",
       " '\"Betty is right, Bess, don\\'t frighten her,\" said Colonel Zane. \"I\\'m\\r afraid I talked too much to-day. But, Miss Helen, you were so\\r interested, and are such a good listener, that I couldn\\'t refrain.\\r Once for all let me say that you will no doubt see stirring life here;\\r but there is little danger of its affecting you. To be sure I think\\r you\\'ll have troubles; but not with Indians or outlaws.\"',\n",
       " 'He winked at his wife and sister. At first Helen did not understand\\r his sally, but then she blushed red all over her fair face.',\n",
       " \"Some time after that, while unpacking her belongings, she heard the\\r clatter of horses' hoofs on the rocky road, accompanied by loud\\r voices. Running to the window, she saw a group of men at the gate.\",\n",
       " '\"Miss Sheppard, will you come out?\" called Colonel Zane\\'s sister from\\r the door. \"My brother Jonathan has returned.\"',\n",
       " 'Helen joined Betty at the door, and looked over her shoulder.',\n",
       " '\"Wal, Jack, ye got two on \\'em, anyways,\" drawled a voice which she\\r recognized as that of Elsing\\'s.',\n",
       " 'A man, lithe and supple, slipped from the back of one of the horses,\\r and, giving the halter to Elsing with a single word, turned and\\r entered the gate. Colonel Zane met him there.',\n",
       " '\"Well, Jonathan, what\\'s up?\"',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s hell to pay,\" was the reply, and the speaker\\'s voice rang\\r clear and sharp.',\n",
       " \"Colonel Zane laid his hand on his brother's shoulder, and thus they\\r stood for a moment, singularly alike, and yet the sturdy pioneer was,\\r somehow, far different from the dark-haired borderman.\",\n",
       " '\"I thought we\\'d trouble in store from the look on your face,\" said the\\r colonel calmly. \"I hope you haven\\'t very bad news on the first day,\\r for our old friends from Virginia.\"',\n",
       " '\"Jonathan,\" cried Betty when he did not answer the colonel. At her\\r call he half turned, and his dark eyes, steady, strained like those of\\r a watching deer, sought his sister\\'s face.',\n",
       " '\"Betty, old Jake Lane was murdered by horse thieves yesterday, and\\r Mabel Lane is gone.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" gasped Betty; but she said nothing more.',\n",
       " 'Colonel Zane cursed inaudibly.',\n",
       " '\"You know, Eb, I tried to keep Lane in the settlement for Mabel\\'s\\r sake. But he wanted to work that farm. I believe horse-stealing wasn\\'t\\r as much of an object as the girl. Pretty women are bad for the border,\\r or any other place, I guess. Wetzel has taken the trail, and I came in\\r because I\\'ve serious suspicions--I\\'ll explain to you alone.\"',\n",
       " 'The borderman bowed gravely to Helen, with a natural grace, and yet a\\r manner that sat awkwardly upon him. The girl, slightly flushed, and\\r somewhat confused by this meeting with the man around whom her\\r romantic imagination had already woven a story, stood in the doorway\\r after giving him a fleeting glance, the fairest, sweetest picture of\\r girlish beauty ever seen.',\n",
       " 'The men went into the house; but their voices came distinctly through\\r the door.',\n",
       " '\"Eb, if Bing Legget or Girty ever see that big-eyed lass, they\\'ll have\\r her even if Fort Henry has to be burned, an\\' in case they do get her,\\r Wetzel an\\' I\\'ll have taken our last trail.\"',\n",
       " \"Supper over, Colonel Zane led his guests to a side porch, where they\\r were soon joined by Mrs. Zane and Betty. The host's two boys, Noah and\\r Sammy, who had preceded them, were now astride the porch-rail and, to\\r judge by their antics, were riding wild Indian mustangs.\",\n",
       " '\"It\\'s quite cool,\" said Colonel Zane; \"but I want you to see the\\r sunset in the valley. A good many of your future neighbors may come\\r over to-night for a word of welcome. It\\'s the border custom.\"',\n",
       " 'He was about to seat himself by the side of Mr. Sheppard, on a rustic\\r bench, when a Negro maid appeared in the doorway carrying a smiling,\\r black-eyed baby. Colonel Zane took the child and, holding it aloft,\\r said with fatherly pride:',\n",
       " '\"This is Rebecca Zane, the first girl baby born to the Zanes, and\\r destined to be the belle of the border.\"',\n",
       " '\"May I have her?\" asked Helen softly, holding out her arms. She took\\r the child, and placed it upon her knee where its look of solemnity\\r soon changed to one of infantile delight.',\n",
       " '\"Here come Nell and Jim,\" said Mrs. Zane, pointing toward the fort.',\n",
       " '\"Yes, and there comes my brother Silas with his wife, too,\" added\\r Colonel Zane. \"The first couple are James Douns, our young minister,\\r and Nell, his wife. They came out here a year or so ago. James had a\\r brother Joe, the finest young fellow who ever caught the border fever.\\r He was killed by one of the Girtys. His was a wonderful story, and\\r some day you shall hear about the parson and his wife.\"',\n",
       " '\"What\\'s the border fever?\" asked Mr. Sheppard.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s what brought you out here,\" replied Colonel Zane with a hearty\\r laugh.',\n",
       " 'Helen gazed with interest at the couple now coming into the yard, and\\r when they gained the porch she saw that the man was big and tall, with\\r a frank, manly bearing, while his wife was a slender little woman with\\r bright, sunny hair, and a sweet, smiling face. They greeted Helen and\\r her father cordially.',\n",
       " \"Next came Silas Zane, a typical bronzed and bearded pioneer, with his\\r buxom wife. Presently a little group of villagers joined the party.\\r They were rugged men, clad in faded buckskins, and sober-faced women\\r who wore dresses of plain gray linsey. They welcomed the newcomers\\r with simple, homely courtesy. Then six young frontiersmen appeared\\r from around a corner of the cabin, advancing hesitatingly. To Helen\\r they all looked alike, tall, awkward, with brown faces and big hands.\\r When Colonel Zane cheerily cried out to them, they stumbled forward\\r with evident embarrassment, each literally crushing Helen's hand in\\r his horny palm. Afterward they leaned on the rail and stole glances\\r at her.\",\n",
       " 'Soon a large number of villagers were on the porch or in the yard.\\r After paying their respects to Helen and her father they took part in\\r a general conversation. Two or three girls, the latest callers, were\\r surrounded by half a dozen young fellows, and their laughter sounded\\r high above the hum of voices.',\n",
       " \"Helen gazed upon this company with mingled feelings of relief and\\r pleasure. She had been more concerned regarding the young people with\\r whom her lot might be cast, than the dangers of which others had told.\\r She knew that on the border there was no distinction of rank. Though\\r she came of an old family, and, during her girlhood, had been\\r surrounded by refinement, even luxury, she had accepted cheerfully the\\r reverses of fortune, and was determined to curb the pride which had\\r been hers. It was necessary she should have friends. Warm-hearted,\\r impulsive and loving, she needed to have around her those in whom she\\r could confide. Therefore it was with sincere pleasure she understood\\r how groundless were her fears and knew that if she did not find good,\\r true friends the fault would be her own. She saw at a glance that the\\r colonel's widowed sister was her equal, perhaps her superior, in\\r education and breeding, while Nellie Douns was as well-bred and\\r gracious a little lady as she had ever met. Then, the other girls,\\r too, were charming, with frank wholesomeness and freedom.\",\n",
       " 'Concerning the young men, of whom there were about a dozen, Helen had\\r hardly arrived at a conclusion. She liked the ruggedness, the signs of\\r honest worth which clung to them. Despite her youth, she had been much\\r sought after because of her personal attractions, and had thus added\\r experience to the natural keen intuition all women possess. The\\r glances of several of the men, particularly the bold regard of one\\r Roger Brandt, whom Colonel Zane introduced, she had seen before, and\\r learned to dislike. On the whole, however, she was delighted with the\\r prospect of new friends and future prosperity, and she felt even\\r greater pleasure in the certainty that her father shared her\\r gratification.',\n",
       " \"Suddenly she became aware that the conversation had ceased. She looked\\r up to see the tall, lithe form of Jonathan Zane as he strode across\\r the porch. She could see that a certain constraint had momentarily\\r fallen upon the company. It was an involuntary acknowledgment of the\\r borderman's presence, of a presence that worked on all alike with a\\r subtle, strong magnetism.\",\n",
       " '\"Ah, Jonathan, come out to see the sunset? It\\'s unusually fine\\r to-night,\" said Colonel Zane.',\n",
       " 'With hardly more than a perceptible bow to those present, the\\r borderman took a seat near the rail, and, leaning upon it, directed\\r his gaze westward.',\n",
       " 'Helen sat so near she could have touched him. She was conscious of the\\r same strange feeling, and impelling sense of power, which had come\\r upon her so strongly at first sight of him. More than that, a lively\\r interest had been aroused in her. This borderman was to her a new and\\r novel character. She was amused at learning that here was a young man\\r absolutely indifferent to the charms of the opposite sex, and although\\r hardly admitting such a thing, she believed it would be possible to\\r win him from his indifference. On raising her eyelids, it was with the\\r unconcern which a woman feigns when suspecting she is being regarded\\r with admiring eyes. But Jonathan Zane might not have known of her\\r presence, for all the attention he paid her. Therefore, having a good\\r opportunity to gaze at this borderman of daring deeds, Helen regarded\\r him closely.',\n",
       " 'He was clad from head to foot in smooth, soft buckskin which fitted\\r well his powerful frame. Beaded moccasins, leggings bound high above\\r the knees, hunting coat laced and fringed, all had the neat, tidy\\r appearance due to good care. He wore no weapons. His hair fell in a\\r raven mass over his shoulders. His profile was regular, with a long,\\r straight nose, strong chin, and eyes black as night. They were now\\r fixed intently on the valley. The whole face gave an impression of\\r serenity, of calmness.',\n",
       " \"Helen was wondering if the sad, almost stern, tranquility of that face\\r ever changed, when the baby cooed and held out its chubby little\\r hands. Jonathan's smile, which came quickly, accompanied by a warm\\r light in the eyes, relieved Helen of an unaccountable repugnance she\\r had begun to feel toward the borderman. That smile, brief as a flash,\\r showed his gentle kindness and told that he was not a creature who had\\r set himself apart from human life and love.\",\n",
       " \"As he took little Rebecca, one of his hands touched Helen's. If he had\\r taken heed of the contact, as any ordinary man might well have, she\\r would, perhaps, have thought nothing about it, but because he did not\\r appear to realize that her hand had been almost inclosed in his, she\\r could not help again feeling his singular personality. She saw that\\r this man had absolutely no thought of her. At the moment this did not\\r awaken resentment, for with all her fire and pride she was not vain;\\r but amusement gave place to a respect which came involuntarily.\",\n",
       " \"Little Rebecca presently manifested the faithlessness peculiar to her\\r sex, and had no sooner been taken upon Jonathan's knee than she cried\\r out to go back to Helen.\",\n",
       " '\"Girls are uncommon coy critters,\" said he, with a grave smile in his\\r eyes. He handed back the child, and once more was absorbed in the\\r setting sun.',\n",
       " 'Helen looked down the valley to behold the most beautiful spectacle\\r she had ever seen. Between the hills far to the west, the sky flamed\\r with a red and gold light. The sun was poised above the river, and the\\r shimmering waters merged into a ruddy horizon. Long rays of crimson\\r fire crossed the smooth waters. A few purple clouds above caught the\\r refulgence, until aided by the delicate rose and blue space beyond,\\r they became many hued ships sailing on a rainbow sea. Each second saw\\r a gorgeous transformation. Slowly the sun dipped into the golden\\r flood; one by one the clouds changed from crimson to gold, from gold\\r to rose, and then to gray; slowly all the tints faded until, as the\\r sun slipped out of sight, the brilliance gave way to the soft\\r afterglow of warm lights. These in turn slowly toned down into\\r gray twilight.',\n",
       " \"Helen retired to her room soon afterward, and, being unusually\\r thoughtful, sat down by the window. She reviewed the events of this\\r first day of her new life on the border. Her impressions had been so\\r many, so varied, that she wanted to distinguish them. First she felt\\r glad, with a sweet, warm thankfulness, that her father seemed so\\r happy, so encouraged by the outlook. Breaking old ties had been, she\\r knew, no child's play for him. She realized also that it had been done\\r solely because there had been nothing left to offer her in the old\\r home, and in a new one were hope and possibilities. Then she was\\r relieved at getting away from the attentions of a man whose\\r persistence had been most annoying to her. From thoughts of her\\r father, and the old life, she came to her new friends of the present.\\r She was so grateful for their kindness. She certainly would do all in\\r her power to win and keep their esteem.\",\n",
       " 'Somewhat of a surprise was it to her, that she reserved for Jonathan\\r Zane the last and most prominent place in her meditations. She\\r suddenly asked herself how she regarded this fighting borderman. She\\r recalled her unbounded enthusiasm for the man as Colonel Zane had told\\r of him; then her first glimpse, and her surprise and admiration at the\\r lithe-limbed young giant; then incredulity, amusement, and respect\\r followed in swift order, after which an unaccountable coldness that\\r was almost resentment. Helen was forced to admit that she did not know\\r how to regard him, but surely he was a man, throughout every inch of\\r his superb frame, and one who took life seriously, with neither\\r thought nor time for the opposite sex. And this last brought a blush\\r to her cheek, for she distinctly remembered she had expected, if not\\r admiration, more than passing notice from this hero of the border.',\n",
       " 'Presently she took a little mirror from a table near where she sat.\\r Holding it to catch the fast-fading light, she studied her face\\r seriously.',\n",
       " '\"Helen Sheppard, I think on the occasion of your arrival in a new\\r country a little plain talk will be wholesome. Somehow or other,\\r perhaps because of a crowd of idle men back there in the colonies,\\r possibly from your own misguided fancy, you imagined you were fair to\\r look at.

The bordermen believed another company of Indians was\\r approaching; but they soon saw it was a single white man leading a\\r number of horses. He departed before daybreak. Wetzel and Jonathan\\r could not get a clear view of him owing to the dim light; but they\\r heard his voice, and afterwards found the imprint of his moccasins.\\r They did, however, recognize the six horses as belonging to settlers\\r in Yellow Creek.',\n",

In the morning he\\r sometimes lay with Colonel Zane's dog, Chief, by the side of a spring\\r under an elm tree, and in the afternoon strolled aimlessly along the\\r river bluff, or on the hillside. At night he sat on his brother's\\r porch smoking a long Indian pipe. Since that day, now a week past,\\r when he had returned with the stolen horses, his movements and habits\\r were precisely what would have been expected of an unsuspicious\\r borderman.\",\n",
       " 'In reality, however, Jonathan was not what he seemed. He knew all that\\r was going on in the settlement. Hardly a bird could have entered the\\r clearing unobserved.',\n",
       " 'At night, after all the villagers were in bed, he stole cautiously\\r about the stockade, silencing with familiar word the bristling\\r watch-hounds, and went from barn to barn, ending his stealthy tramp at\\r the corral where Colonel Zane kept his thoroughbreds.',\n",
       " 'But all this scouting by night availed nothing. No unusual event\\r occurred, not even the barking of a dog, a suspicious rustling among\\r the thickets, or whistling of a night-hawk had been heard.',\n",
       " 'Vainly the borderman strained ears to catch some low night-signal\\r given by waiting Indians to the white traitor within the settlement.\\r By day there was even less to attract the sharp-eyed watcher. The\\r clumsy river boats, half raft, half sawn lumber, drifted down the Ohio\\r on their first and last voyage, discharged their cargoes of grain,\\r liquor, or merchandise, and were broken up. Their crews came back on\\r the long overland journey to Fort Pitt, there to man another craft.\\r The garrison at the fort performed their customary duties; the\\r pioneers tilled the fields; the blacksmith scattered sparks, the\\r wheelwright worked industriously at his bench, and the housewives\\r attended to their many cares. No strangers arrived at Fort Henry. The\\r quiet life of the village was uninterrupted.',\n",
       " \"Near sunset of a long day Jonathan strolled down the sandy,\\r well-trodden path toward Metzar's inn. He did not drink, and\\r consequently seldom visited the rude, dark, ill-smelling bar-room.\\r When occasion demanded his presence there, he was evidently not\\r welcome. The original owner, a sturdy soldier and pioneer, came to\\r Fort Henry when Colonel Zane founded the settlement, and had been\\r killed during Girty's last attack. His successor, another Metzar, was,\\r according to Jonathan's belief, as bad as the whiskey he dispensed.\\r More than one murder had been committed at the inn; countless fatal\\r knife and tomahawk fights had stained red the hard clay floor; and\\r more than one desperate character had been harbored there. Once\\r Colonel Zane sent Wetzel there to invite a thief and outlaw to quit\\r the settlement, with the not unexpected result that it became\\r necessary the robber be carried out.\",\n",
       " 'Jonathan thought of the bad name the place bore all over the frontier,\\r and wondered if Metzar could tell anything about the horse-thieves.\\r When the borderman bent his tall frame to enter the low-studded door\\r he fancied he saw a dark figure disappear into a room just behind the\\r bar. A roughly-clad, heavily-bearded man turned hastily at the\\r same moment.',\n",
       " '\"Hullo,\" he said gruffly.',\n",
       " '\"H\\' are you, Metzar. I just dropped in to see if I could make a trade\\r for your sorrel mare,\" replied Jonathan. Being well aware that the\\r innkeeper would not part with his horse, the borderman had made this\\r announcement as his reason for entering the bar-room.',\n",
       " '\"Nope, I\\'ll allow you can\\'t,\" replied Metzar.',\n",
       " \"As he turned to go, Jonathan's eyes roamed around the bar-room.\\r Several strangers of shiftless aspect bleared at him.\",\n",
       " '\"They wouldn\\'t steal a pumpkin,\" muttered Jonathan to himself as he\\r left the inn. Then he added suspiciously, \"Metzar was talkin\\' to some\\r one, an\\' \\'peared uneasy. I never liked Metzar. He\\'ll bear watchin\\'.\"',\n",
       " 'The borderman passed on down the path thinking of what he had heard\\r against Metzar. The colonel had said that the man was prosperous for\\r an innkeeper who took pelts, grain or meat in exchange for rum. The\\r village gossips disliked him because he was unmarried, taciturn, and\\r did not care for their company. Jonathan reflected also on the fact\\r that Indians were frequently coming to the inn, and this made him\\r distrustful of the proprietor. It was true that Colonel Zane had\\r red-skinned visitors, but there was always good reason for their\\r coming. Jonathan had seen, during the Revolution, more than one\\r trusted man proven to be a traitor, and the conviction settled upon\\r him that some quiet scouting would show up the innkeeper as aiding the\\r horse-thieves if not actually in league with them.',\n",
       " '\"Good evening, Jonathan Zane.\"',\n",
       " \"This greeting in a woman's clear voice brought Jonathan out from his\\r reveries. He glanced up to see Helen Sheppard standing in the doorway\\r of her father's cabin.\",\n",
       " '\"Evenin\\', miss,\" he said with a bow, and would have passed on.',\n",
       " '\"Wait,\" she cried, and stepped out of the door.',\n",

       " 'Helen, piqued at his curt greeting, had asked him to wait without any\\r idea of what she would say. Coming slowly down the path she felt again\\r a subtle awe of this borderman. Regretting her impulsiveness, she lost\\r confidence.',\n",
       " \"Gaining the gate she looked up intending to speak; but was unable to\\r do so as she saw how cold and grave was his face, and how piercing\\r were his eyes. She flushed slightly, and then, conscious of an\\r embarrassment new and strange to her, blushed rosy red, making, as it\\r seemed to her, a stupid remark about the sunset. When he took her\\r words literally, and said the sunset was fine, she felt guilty of\\r deceitfulness. Whatever Helen's faults, and they were many, she was\\r honest, and because of not having looked at the sunset, but only\\r wanting him to see her as did other men, the innocent ruse suddenly\\r appeared mean and trifling.\",\n",
       " \"Then, with a woman's quick intuition, she understood that coquetries\\r were lost on this borderman, and, with a smile, got the better of her\\r embarrassment and humiliation by telling the truth.\",\n",
       " '\"I wanted to ask a favor of you, and I\\'m a little afraid.\"',\n",
       " 'She spoke with girlish shyness, which increased as he stared at her.',\n",

       " '\"So my white dress makes me look ghostly,\" she answered lightly,\\r though deeply conscious of surprise and pleasure at such an unexpected\\r reply from him. This borderman might be full of surprises. \"Such a\\r time as I had bringing my dresses out here! I don\\'t know when I can\\r wear them. This is the simplest one.\"',\n",
       " '\"An\\' it\\'s mighty new an\\' bewilderin\\' for the border,\" he replied with\\r a smile in his eyes.',\n",
       " '\"When these are gone I\\'ll get no more except linsey ones,\" she said\\r brightly, yet her eyes shone with a wistful uncertainty of the future.',\n",
       " '\"Will you be happy here?\"',\n",
       " '\"I am happy. I have always wanted to be of some use in the world. I\\r assure you, Master Zane, I am not the butterfly I seem. I have worked\\r hard all day, that is, until your sister Betty came over. All the\\r girls have helped me fix up the cabin until it\\'s more comfortable than\\r I ever dreamed one could be on the frontier. Father is well content\\r here, and that makes me happy. I haven\\'t had time for forebodings. The\\r young men of Fort Henry have been--well, attentive; in fact, they\\'ve\\r been here all the time.\"',\n",
       " 'She laughed a little at this last remark, and looked demurely at him.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a frontier custom,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, indeed? Do all the young men call often and stay late?\"',\n",

       " '\"Oh, you don\\'t? Do you expect them to wait on you?\" she asked,\\r feeling, now she had made this silent man talk, once more at her ease.',\n",
       " '\"I am a borderman,\" replied Jonathan. There was a certain dignity or\\r sadness in his answer which reminded Helen of Colonel Zane\\'s portrayal\\r of a borderman\\'s life. It struck her keenly. Here was this young giant\\r standing erect and handsome before her, as rugged as one of the ash\\r trees of his beloved forest. Who could tell when his strong life might\\r be ended by an Indian\\'s hatchet?',\n",
       " '\"For you, then, is there no such thing as friendship?\" she asked.',\n",
       " '\"On the border men are serious.\"',\n",
       " \"This recalled his sister's conversation regarding the attentions of\\r the young men, that they would follow her, fight for her, and give her\\r absolutely no peace until one of them had carried her to his cabin\\r a bride.\",\n",
       " \"She could not carry on the usual conventional conversation with this\\r borderman, but remained silent for a time. She realized more keenly\\r than ever before how different he was from other men, and watched\\r closely as he stood gazing out over the river. Perhaps something she\\r had said caused him to think of the many pleasures and joys he missed.\\r But she could not be certain what was in his mind. She was not\\r accustomed to impassive faces and cold eyes with unlit fires in their\\r dark depths. More likely he was thinking of matters nearer to his\\r wild, free life; of his companion Wetzel somewhere out beyond those\\r frowning hills. Then she remembered that the colonel had told her of\\r his brother's love for nature in all its forms; how he watched the\\r shades of evening fall; lost himself in contemplation of the last\\r copper glow flushing the western sky, or became absorbed in the bright\\r stars. Possibly he had forgotten her presence. Darkness was rapidly\\r stealing down upon them. The evening, tranquil and gray, crept over\\r them with all its mystery. He was a part of it. She could not hope to\\r understand him; but saw clearly that his was no common personality.\\r She wanted to speak, to voice a sympathy strong within her; but she\\r did not know what to say to this borderman.\",\n",
       " '\"If what your sister tells me of the border is true, I may soon need a\\r friend,\" she said, after weighing well her words. She faced him\\r modestly yet bravely, and looked him straight in the eyes. Because he\\r did not reply she spoke again.',\n",
       " '\"I mean such a friend as you or Wetzel.\"',\n",
       " '\"You may count on both,\" he replied.',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" she said softly, giving him her hand. \"I shall not\\r forget. One more thing. Will you break a borderman\\'s custom, for\\r my sake?\"',\n",
       " '\"How?\"',\n",
       " '\"Come to see me when you are in the settlement?\"',\n",
       " \"Helen said this in a low voice with just a sob in her breath; but she\\r met his gaze fairly.

       " '\"No,\" he answered gently.',\n",
       " 'Helen was not prepared for such a rebuff. She was interested in him,\\r and not ashamed to show it. She feared only that he might\\r misunderstand her; but to refuse her proffered friendship, that was\\r indeed unexpected. Rude she thought it was, while from brow to curving\\r throat her fair skin crimsoned. Then her face grew pale as the\\r moonlight. Hard on her resentment had surged the swell of some new\\r emotion strong and sweet. He refused her friendship because he did not\\r dare accept it; because his life was not his own; because he was a\\r borderman.',\n",
       " 'While they stood thus, Jonathan looking perplexed and troubled,\\r feeling he had hurt her, but knowing not what to say, and Helen with a\\r warm softness in her eyes, the stalwart figure of a man loomed out of\\r the gathering darkness.',\n",

Advancing nearer the\\r yard, he heard the murmur of voices in gay conversation, and soon saw\\r figures moving about under the trees.',\n",
       " \"No doubt was in his mind but that the man who gave the signal to warn\\r the Indians, was one of Helen Sheppard's guests.\",\n",
       " 'Jonathan had walked across the street then down the path, before he\\r saw the colonel coming from the opposite direction. Halting under a\\r maple he waited for his brother to approach.',\n",

       " '\"No!\"',\n",
       " 'Colonel Zane swore, as was his habit when exasperated. Kind and\\r generous man that he was, it went hard with him to believe in the\\r guilt of any of the young men he had trusted. But Jonathan had said\\r there was a traitor among them, and Colonel Zane did not question this\\r assertion. He knew the borderman. During years full of strife, and\\r war, and blood had he lived beside this silent man who said little,\\r but that little was the truth. Therefore Colonel Zane gave way\\r to anger.',\n",
       " '\"Well, I\\'m not so damned surprised! What\\'s to be done?\"',\n",
       " '\"Find out what men are there?\"',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s easy. I\\'ll go to see George and soon have the truth.\"',\n",
       " '\"Won\\'t do,\" said the borderman decisively. \"Go back to the barn, an\\'\\r look after the hosses.\"',\n",
       " 'When Colonel Zane had obeyed Jonathan dropped to his hands and knees,\\r and swiftly, with the agile movements of an Indian, gained a corner of\\r the Sheppard yard. He crouched in the shade of a big plum tree. Then,\\r at a favorable opportunity, vaulted the fence and disappeared under a\\r clump of lilac bushes.',\n",
       " 'The evening wore away no more tediously to the borderman, than to\\r those young frontiersmen who were whispering tender or playful words\\r to their partners. Time and patience were the same to Jonathan Zane.\\r He lay hidden under the fragrant lilacs, his eyes, accustomed to the\\r dark from long practice, losing no movement of the guests. Finally it\\r became evident that the party was at an end. One couple took the\\r initiative, and said good night to their hostess.',\n",
       " '\"Tom Bennet, I hope it\\'s not you,\" whispered the borderman to himself,\\r as he recognized the young fellow.',\n",
       " 'A general movement followed, until the merry party were assembled\\r about Helen near the front gate.',\n",
       " '\"Jim Morrison, I\\'ll bet it\\'s not you,\" was Jonathan\\'s comment. \"That\\r soldier Williams is doubtful; Hart an\\' Johnson being strangers, are\\r unknown quantities around here, an\\' then comes Brandt.\"',\n",
       " 'All departed except Brandt, who remained talking to Helen in low,\\r earnest tones. Jonathan lay very quietly, trying to decide what should\\r be his next move in the unraveling of the mystery. He paid little\\r attention to the young couple, but could not help overhearing their\\r conversation.',\n",
       " '\"Indeed, Mr. Brandt, you frontiersmen are not backward,\" Helen was\\r saying in her clear voice. \"I am surprised to learn that you love me\\r upon such short acquaintance, and am sorry, too, for I hardly know\\r whether I even so much as like you.\"',\n",
       " '\"I love you. We men of the border do things rapidly,\" he replied\\r earnestly.',\n",
       " '\"So it seems,\" she said with a soft laugh.',\n",
       " '\"Won\\'t you care for me?\" he pleaded.',\n",
       " '\"Nothing is surer than that I never know what I am going to do,\" Helen\\r replied lightly.',\n",
       " '\"All these fellows are in love with you. They can\\'t help it any more\\r than I. You are the most glorious creature. Please give me hope.\"',\n",
       " '\"Mr. Brandt, let go my hand. I\\'m afraid I don\\'t like such impulsive\\r men.\"',\n",
       " '\"Please let me hold your hand.\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not.\"',\n",
       " '\"But I will hold it, and if you look at me like that again I\\'ll do\\r more,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"What, bold sir frontiersman?\" she returned, lightly still, but in a\\r voice which rang with a deeper note.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll kiss you,\" he cried desperately.',\n",
       " '\"You wouldn\\'t dare.\"',\n",
       " '\"Wouldn\\'t I though? You don\\'t know us border fellows yet. You come\\r here with your wonderful beauty, and smile at us with that light in\\r your eyes which makes men mad. Oh, you\\'ll pay for it.\"',\n",
       " \"The borderman listened to all this love-making half disgusted, until\\r he began to grow interested. Brandt's back was turned to him, and\\r Helen stood so that the light from the pine cones shone on her face.\\r Her eyes were brilliant, otherwise she seemed a woman perfectly\\r self-possessed. Brandt held her hand despite the repeated efforts she\\r made to free it. But she did not struggle violently, or make\\r an outcry.\",\n",
       " 'Suddenly Brandt grasped her other hand, pulling her toward him.',\n",
       " '\"These other fellows will kiss you, and I\\'m going to be the first!\" he\\r declared passionately.',\n",
       " \"Helen drew back, now thoroughly alarmed by the man's fierce energy.\\r She had been warned against this very boldness in frontiersmen; but\\r had felt secure in her own pride and dignity. Her blood boiled at the\\r thought that she must exert strength to escape insult. She struggled\\r violently when Brandt bent his head. Almost sick with fear, she had\\r determined to call for help, when a violent wrench almost toppled her\\r over. At the same instant her wrists were freed; she heard a fierce\\r cry, a resounding blow, and then the sodden thud of a heavy body\\r falling. Recovering her balance, she saw a tall figure beside her, and\\r a man in the act of rising from the ground.\",\n",
       " '\"You?\" whispered Helen, recognizing the tall figure as Jonathan\\'s.',\n",
       " 'The borderman did not answer. He stepped forward, slipping his hand\\r inside his hunting frock. Brandt sprang nimbly to his feet, and with a\\r face which, even in the dim light, could be seen distorted with fury,\\r bent forward to look at the stranger. He, too, had his hand within his\\r coat, as if grasping a weapon; but he did not draw it.',\n",
       " '\"Zane, a lighter blow would have been easier to forget,\" he cried, his\\r voice clear and cutting. Then he turned to the girl. \"Miss Helen, I\\r got what I deserved. I crave your forgiveness, and ask you to\\r understand a man who was once a gentleman. If I am one no longer, the\\r frontier is to blame. I was mad to treat you as I did.\"',\n",
       " 'Thus speaking, he bowed low with the grace of a man sometimes used to\\r the society of ladies, and then went out of the gate.',\n",
       " '\"Where did you come from?\" asked Helen, looking up at Jonathan.',\n",
       " 'He pointed under the lilac bushes.',\n",
       " '\"Were you there?\" she asked wonderingly. \"Did you hear all?\"',\n",
       " '\"I couldn\\'t help hearin\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"It was fortunate for me; but why--why were you there?\"',\n",
       " 'Helen came a step nearer, and regarded him curiously with her great\\r eyes now black with excitement.',\n",
       " 'The borderman was silent.',\n",
       " \"Helen's softened mood changed instantly. There was nothing in his cold\\r face which might have betrayed in him a sentiment similar to that of\\r her admirers.\",\n",
       " '\"Did you spy on me?\" she asked quickly, after a moment\\'s thought.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" replied Jonathan calmly.',\n",
       " 'Helen gazed in perplexity at this strange man. She did not know how to\\r explain it; she was irritated, but did her best to conceal it. He had\\r no interest in her, yet had hidden under the lilacs in her yard. She\\r was grateful because he had saved her from annoyance, yet could not\\r fathom his reason for being so near.',\n",
       " '\"Did you come here to see me?\" she asked, forgetting her vexation.',\n",
       " '\"No.\"',\n",
       " '\"What for, then?\"',\n",
       " '\"I reckon I won\\'t say,\" was the quiet, deliberate refusal.',\n",
       " 'Helen stamped her foot in exasperation.',\n",
       " '\"Be careful that I do not put a wrong construction on your strange\\r action,\" said she coldly. \"If you have reasons, you might trust me. If\\r you are only----\"',\n",
       " '\"Sh-s-sh!\" he breathed, grasping her wrist, and holding it firmly in\\r his powerful hand. The whole attitude of the man had altered swiftly,\\r subtly. The listlessness was gone. His lithe body became rigid as he\\r leaned forward, his head toward the ground, and turned slightly in a\\r manner that betokened intent listening.',\n",
       " 'Helen trembled as she felt his powerful frame quiver. Whatever had\\r thus changed him, gave her another glimpse of his complex personality.\\r It seemed to her incredible that with one whispered exclamation this\\r man could change from cold indifference to a fire and force so strong\\r as to dominate her.',\n",
       " 'Statue-like she remained listening; but hearing no sound, and\\r thrillingly conscious of the hand on her arm.',\n",
       " 'Far up on the hillside an owl hooted dismally, and an instant later,\\r faint and far away, came an answer so low as to be almost indistinct.',\n",
       " 'The borderman raised himself erect as he released her.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s only an owl,\" she said in relief.',\n",
       " 'His eyes gleamed like stars.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s Wetzel, an\\' it means Injuns!\"',\n",
       " 'Then he was gone into the darkness.',\n",
       " 'In the misty morning twilight Colonel Zane, fully armed, paced to and\\r fro before his cabin, on guard. All night he had maintained a watch.\\r He had not considered it necessary to send his family into the fort,\\r to which they had often been compelled to flee. On the previous night\\r Jonathan had come swiftly back to the cabin, and, speaking but two\\r words, seized his weapons and vanished into the black night. The words\\r were \"Injuns! Wetzel!\" and there were none others with more power to\\r affect hearers on the border. The colonel believed that Wetzel had\\r signaled to Jonathan.',\n",
       " 'On the west a deep gully with precipitous sides separated the\\r settlement from a high, wooded bluff. Wetzel often returned from his\\r journeying by this difficult route. He had no doubt seen Indian signs,\\r and had communicated the intelligence to Jonathan by their system of\\r night-bird calls. The nearness of the mighty hunter reassured\\r Colonel Zane.',\n",
       " \"When the colonel returned from his chase of the previous night, he\\r went directly to the stable, there to find that the Indians had made\\r off with a thoroughbred, and Betty's pony. Colonel Zane was furious,\\r not on account of the value of the horses, but because Bess was his\\r favorite bay, and Betty loved nothing more than her pony Madcap. To\\r have such a march stolen on him after he had heard and seen the\\r thieves was indeed hard. High time it was that these horse thieves be\\r run to earth. No Indian had planned these marauding expeditions. An\\r intelligent white man was at the bottom of the thieving, and he should\\r pay for his treachery.\",\n",
       " \"The colonel's temper, however, soon cooled. He realized after thinking\\r over the matter, that he was fortunate it passed off without\\r bloodshed. Very likely the intent had been to get all his horses,\\r perhaps his neighbor's as well, and it had been partly frustrated by\\r Jonathan's keen sagacity. These Shawnees, white leader or not, would\\r never again run such risks.\",\n",
       " '\"It\\'s like a skulking Shawnee,\" muttered Colonel Zane, \"to slip down\\r here under cover of early dusk, when no one but an Indian hunter could\\r detect him. I didn\\'t look for trouble, especially so soon after the\\r lesson we gave Girty and his damned English and redskins. It\\'s lucky\\r Jonathan was here. I\\'ll go back to the old plan of stationing scouts\\r at the outposts until snow flies.\"',\n",
       " 'While Colonel Zane talked to himself and paced the path he had\\r selected to patrol, the white mists cleared, and a rosy hue followed\\r the brightening in the east. The birds ceased twittering to break into\\r gay songs, and the cock in the barnyard gave one final clarion-voiced\\r salute to the dawn. The rose in the east deepened into rich red, and\\r then the sun peeped over the eastern hilltops to drench the valley\\r with glad golden light.',\n",
       " 'A blue smoke curling lazily from the stone chimney of his cabin,\\r showed that Sam had made the kitchen fire, and a little later a rich,\\r savory odor gave pleasing evidence that his wife was cooking\\r breakfast.',\n",
       " '\"Any sign of Jack?\" a voice called from the open door, and Betty\\r appeared.',\n",
       " '\"Nary sign.\"',\n",
       " '\"Of the Indians, then?\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, Betts, they left you a token of their regard,\" and Colonel Zane\\r smiled as he took a broken halter from the fence.',\n",
       " '\"Madcap?\" cried Betty.',\n",
       " '\"Yes, they\\'ve taken Madcap and Bess.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, the villains! Poor pony,\" exclaimed Betty indignantly. \"Eb, I\\'ll\\r coax Wetzel to fetch the pony home if he has to kill every Shawnee in\\r the valley.\"',\n",
       " '\"Now you\\'re talking, Betts,\" Colonel Zane replied. \"If you could get\\r Lew to do that much, you\\'d be blessed from one end of the border to\\r the other.\"',\n",
       " 'He walked up the road; then back, keeping a sharp lookout on all\\r sides, and bestowing a particularly keen glance at the hillside across\\r the ravine, but could see no sign of the bordermen. As it was now\\r broad daylight he felt convinced that further watch was unnecessary,\\r and went in to breakfast. When he came out again the villagers were\\r astir. The sharp strokes of axes rang out on the clear morning air,\\r and a mellow anvil-clang pealed up from the blacksmith shop. Colonel\\r Zane found his brother Silas and Jim Douns near the gate.',\n",
       " '\"Morning, boys,\" he cried cheerily.',\n",
       " '\"Any glimpse of Jack or Lew?\" asked Silas.',\n",
       " '\"No; but I\\'m expecting one of \\'em any moment.\"',\n",
       " '\"How about the Indians?\" asked Douns. \"Silas roused me out last night;\\r but didn\\'t stay long enough to say more than \\'Indians.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know much more than Silas. I saw several of the red devils\\r who stole the horses; but how many, where they\\'ve gone, or what we\\'re\\r to expect, I can\\'t say. We\\'ve got to wait for Jack or Lew. Silas, keep\\r the garrison in readiness at the fort, and don\\'t allow a man, soldier\\r or farmer, to leave the clearing until further orders. Perhaps there\\r were only three of those Shawnees, and then again the woods might have\\r been full of them. I take it something\\'s amiss, or Jack and Lew would\\r be in by now.\"',\n",
       " '\"Here come Sheppard and his girl,\" said Silas, pointing down the lane.\\r \"\\'Pears George is some excited.\"',\n",
       " 'Colonel Zane had much the same idea as he saw Sheppard and his\\r daughter. The old man appeared in a hurry, which was sufficient reason\\r to believe him anxious or alarmed, and Helen looked pale.',\n",
       " '\"Ebenezer, what\\'s this I hear about Indians?\" Sheppard asked\\r excitedly. \"What with Helen\\'s story about the fort being besieged, and\\r this brother of yours routing honest people from their beds, I haven\\'t\\r had a wink of sleep. What\\'s up? Where are the redskins?\"',\n",
       " '\"Now, George, be easy,\" said Colonel Zane calmly. \"And you, Helen,\\r mustn\\'t be frightened. There\\'s no danger. We did have a visit from\\r Indians last night; but they hurt no one, and got only two horses.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I\\'m so relieved that it\\'s not worse,\" said Helen.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s bad enough, Helen,\" Betty cried, her black eyes flashing, \"my\\r pony Madcap is gone.\"',\n",
       " '\"Colonel Zane, come here quick!\" cried Douns, who stood near the gate.',\n",
       " \"With one leap Colonel Zane was at the gate, and, following with his\\r eyes the direction indicated by Douns' trembling finger, he saw two\\r tall, brown figures striding down the lane. One carried two rifles,\\r and the other a long bundle wrapped in a blanket.\",\n",
       " '\"It\\'s Jack and Wetzel,\" whispered Colonel Zane to Jim. \"They\\'ve got\\r the girl, and by God! from the way that bundle hangs, I think she\\'s\\r dead. Here,\" he added, speaking loudly, \"you women get into\\r the house.\"',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Zane, Betty and Helen stared.',\n",
       " '\"Go into the house!\" he cried authoritatively.',\n",
       " 'Without a protest the three women obeyed.',\n",
       " 'At that moment Nellie Douns came across the lane; Sam shuffled out\\r from the backyard, and Sheppard arose from his seat on the steps. They\\r joined Colonel Zane, Silas and Jim at the gate.',\n",
       " '\"I wondered what kept you so late,\" Colonel Zane said to Jonathan, as\\r he and his companion came up. \"You\\'ve fetched Mabel, and she\\'s----\".\\r The good man could say no more. If he should live an hundred years on\\r the border amid savage murderers, he would still be tender-hearted.\\r Just now he believed the giant borderman by the side of Jonathan held\\r a dead girl, one whom he had danced, when a child, upon his knee.',\n",
       " '\"Mabel, an\\' jest alive,\" replied Jonathan.',\n",
       " '\"By God! I\\'m glad!\" exclaimed Colonel Zane. \"Here, Lew, give her to\\r me.\"',\n",
       " 'Wetzel relinquished his burden to the colonel.',\n",
       " '\"Lew, any bad Indian sign?\" asked Colonel Zane as he turned to go into\\r the house.',\n",
       " 'The borderman shook his head.',\n",
       " '\"Wait for me,\" added the colonel.',\n",
       " 'He carried the girl to that apartment in the cabin which served the\\r purpose of a sitting-room, and laid her on a couch. He gently removed\\r the folds of the blanket, disclosing to view a fragile,\\r white-faced girl.',\n",
       " '\"Bess, hurry, hurry!\" he screamed to his wife, and as she came running\\r in, followed no less hurriedly by Betty, Helen and Nellie, he\\r continued, \"Here\\'s Mabel Lane, alive, poor child; but in sore need of\\r help. First see whether she has any bodily injury. If a bullet must be\\r cut out, or a knife-wound sewed up, it\\'s better she remained\\r unconscious. Betty, run for Bess\\'s instruments, and bring brandy and\\r water. Lively now!\" Then he gave vent to an oath and left the room.',\n",
       " 'Helen, her heart throbbing wildly, went to the side of Mrs. Zane, who\\r was kneeling by the couch. She saw a delicate girl, not over eighteen\\r years old, with a face that would have been beautiful but for the set\\r lips, the closed eyelids, and an expression of intense pain.',\n",
       " '\"Oh! Oh!\" breathed Helen.',\n",
       " '\"Nell, hand me the scissors,\" said Mrs. Zane, \"and help me take off\\r this dress. Why, it\\'s wet, but, thank goodness! \\'tis not with blood. I\\r know that slippery touch too well. There, that\\'s right. Betty, give me\\r a spoonful of brandy. Now heat a blanket, and get one of your linsey\\r gowns for this poor child.\"',\n",
       " \"Helen watched Mrs. Zane as if fascinated. The colonel's wife continued\\r to talk while with deft fingers she forced a few drops of brandy\\r between the girl's closed teeth. Then with the adroitness of a skilled\\r surgeon, she made the examination. Helen had heard of this pioneer\\r woman's skill in setting broken bones and treating injuries, and when\\r she looked from the calm face to the steady fingers, she had no doubt\\r as to the truth of what had been told.\",\n",
       " '\"Neither bullet wound, cut, bruise, nor broken bone,\" said Mrs. Zane.\\r \"It\\'s fear, starvation, and the terrible shock.\"',\n",
       " \"She rubbed Mabel's hands while gazing at her pale face. Then she\\r forced more brandy between the tightly-closed lips. She was rewarded\\r by ever so faint a color tinging the wan cheeks, to be followed by a\\r fluttering of the eyelids. Then the eyes opened wide. They were large,\\r soft, dark and humid with agony.\",\n",
       " 'Helen could not bear their gaze. She saw the shadow of death, and of\\r worse than death. She looked away, while in her heart rose a storm of\\r passionate fury at the brutes who had made of this tender girl\\r a wreck.',\n",
       " 'The room was full of women now, sober-faced matrons and grave-eyed\\r girls, yet all wore the same expression, not alone of anger, nor fear,\\r nor pity, but of all combined.',\n",
       " 'Helen instinctively felt that this was one of the trials of border\\r endurance, and she knew from the sterner faces of the maturer women\\r that such a trial was familiar. Despite all she had been told, the\\r shock and pain were too great, and she went out of the room sobbing.',\n",
       " 'She almost fell over the broad back of Jonathan Zane who was sitting\\r on the steps. Near him stood Colonel Zane talking with a tall man clad\\r in faded buckskin.',\n",
       " '\"Lass, you shouldn\\'t have stayed,\" said Colonel Zane kindly.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s--hurt--me--here,\" said Helen, placing her hand over her heart.',\n",
       " '\"Yes, I know, I know; of course it has,\" he replied, taking her hand.\\r \"But be brave, Helen, bear up, bear up. Oh! this border is a stern\\r place! Do not think of that poor girl. Come, let me introduce\\r Jonathan\\'s friend, Wetzel!\"',\n",
       " 'Helen looked up and held out her hand. She saw a very tall man with\\r extremely broad shoulders, a mass of raven-black hair, and a white\\r face. He stepped forward, and took her hand in his huge, horny palm,\\r pressing it, he stepped back without speaking. Colonel Zane talked to\\r her in a soothing voice; but she failed to hear what he said. This\\r Wetzel, this Indian-hunter whom she had heard called \"Deathwind of the\\r Border,\" this companion, guide, teacher of Jonathan Zane, this\\r borderman of wonderful deeds, stood before her.',\n",
       " \"Helen saw a cold face, deathly in its pallor, lighted by eyes\\r sloe-black but like glinting steel. Striking as were these features,\\r they failed to fascinate as did the strange tracings which apparently\\r showed through the white, drawn skin. This first repelled, then drew\\r her with wonderful force. Suffering, of fire, and frost, and iron was\\r written there, and, stronger than all, so potent as to cause fear,\\r could be read the terrible purpose of this man's tragic life.\",\n",
       " '\"You avenged her! Oh! I know you did!\" cried Helen, her whole heart\\r leaping with a blaze to her eyes.',\n",
       " 'She was answered by a smile, but such a smile! Kindly it broke over\\r the stern face, giving a glimpse of a heart still warm beneath that\\r steely cold. Behind it, too, there was something fateful,\\r something deadly.',\n",
       " 'Helen knew, though the borderman spoke not, that somewhere among the\\r grasses of the broad plains, or on the moss of the wooded hills, lay\\r dead the perpetrators of this outrage, their still faces bearing the\\r ghastly stamp of Deathwind.',\n",
       " 'Happier days than she had hoped for, dawned upon Helen after the first\\r touch of border sorrow. Mabel Lane did not die. Helen and Betty nursed\\r the stricken girl tenderly, weeping for very joy when signs of\\r improvement appeared. She had remained silent for several days, always\\r with that haunting fear in her eyes, and then gradually came a change.\\r Tender care and nursing had due effect in banishing the dark shadow.\\r One morning after a long sleep she awakened with a bright smile, and\\r from that time her improvement was rapid.',\n",
       " \"Helen wanted Mabel to live with her. The girl's position was pitiable.\\r Homeless, fatherless, with not a relative on the border, yet so brave,\\r so patient that she aroused all the sympathy in Helen's breast.\\r Village gossip was in substance, that Mabel had given her love to a\\r young frontiersman, by name Alex Bennet, who had an affection for her,\\r so it was said, but as yet had made no choice between her and the\\r other lasses of the settlement. What effect Mabel's terrible\\r experience might have on this lukewarm lover, Helen could not even\\r guess; but she was not hopeful as to the future. Colonel Zane and\\r Betty approved of Helen's plan to persuade Mabel to live with her, and\\r the latter's faint protestations they silenced by claiming she could\\r be of great assistance in the management of the house, therefore it\\r was settled.\",\n",
       " \"Finally the day came when Mabel was ready to go with Helen. Betty had\\r given her a generous supply of clothing, for all her belongings had\\r been destroyed when the cabin was burned. With Helen's strong young\\r arm around her she voiced her gratitude to Betty and Mrs. Zane and\\r started toward the Sheppard home.\",\n",
       " 'From the green square, where the ground was highest, an unobstructed\\r view could be had of the valley. Mabel gazed down the river to where\\r her home formerly stood. Only a faint, dark spot, like a blur on the\\r green landscape, could be seen. Her soft eyes filled with tears; but\\r she spoke no word.',\n",
       " '\"She\\'s game and that\\'s why she didn\\'t go under,\" Colonel Zane said to\\r himself as he mused on the strength and spirit of borderwomen. To\\r their heroism, more than any other thing, he attributed the\\r establishing of homes in this wilderness.',\n",
       " \"In the days that ensued, as Mabel grew stronger, the girls became very\\r fond of each other. Helen would have been happy at any time with such\\r a sweet companion, but just then, when the poor girl's mind was so\\r sorely disturbed she was doubly glad. For several days, after Mabel\\r was out of danger, Helen's thoughts had dwelt on a subject which\\r caused extreme vexation. She had begun to suspect that she encouraged\\r too many admirers for whom she did not care, and thought too much of a\\r man who did not reciprocate. She was gay and moody in turn. During the\\r moody hours she suspected herself, and in her gay ones, scorned the\\r idea that she might ever care for a man who was indifferent. But that\\r thought once admitted, had a trick of returning at odd moments,\\r clouding her cheerful moods.\",\n",
       " 'One sunshiny morning while the May flowers smiled under the hedge,\\r when dew sparkled on the leaves, and the locust-blossoms shone\\r creamy-white amid the soft green of the trees, the girls set about\\r their much-planned flower gardening. Helen was passionately fond of\\r plants, and had brought a jar of seeds of her favorites all the way\\r from her eastern home.',\n",
       " '\"We\\'ll plant the morning-glories so they\\'ll run up the porch, and the\\r dahlias in this long row and the nasturtiums in this round bed,\"\\r Helen said.',\n",
       " '\"You have some trailing arbutus,\" added Mabel, \"and must have\\r clematis, wild honeysuckle and golden-glow, for they are all\\r sweet flowers.\"',\n",
       " '\"This arbutus is so fresh, so dewy, so fragrant,\" said Helen, bending\\r aside a lilac bush to see the pale, creeping flowers. \"I never saw\\r anything so beautiful. I grow more and more in love with my new home\\r and friends. I have such a pretty garden to look into, and I never\\r tire of the view beyond.\"',\n",
       " 'Helen gazed with pleasure and pride at the garden with its fresh green\\r and lavender-crested lilacs, at the white-blossomed trees, and the\\r vine-covered log cabins with blue smoke curling from their stone\\r chimneys. Beyond, the great bulk of the fort stood guard above the\\r willow-skirted river, and far away over the winding stream the dark\\r hills, defiant, kept their secrets.',\n",
       " '\"If it weren\\'t for that threatening fort one could imagine this little\\r hamlet, nestling under the great bluff, as quiet and secure as it is\\r beautiful,\" said Helen. \"But that charred stockade fence with its\\r scarred bastions and these lowering port-holes, always keep me alive\\r to the reality.\"',\n",
       " '\"It wasn\\'t very quiet when Girty was here,\" Mabel replied\\r thoughtfully.',\n",
       " '\"Were you in the fort then?\" asked Helen breathlessly.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, yes, I cooled the rifles for the men,\" replied Mabel calmly.',\n",
       " '\"Tell me all about it.\"',\n",
       " \"Helen listened again to a story she had heard many times; but told by\\r new lips it always gained in vivid interest. She never tired of\\r hearing how the notorious renegade, Girty, rode around the fort on his\\r white horse, giving the defenders an hour in which to surrender; she\\r learned again of the attack, when the British soldiers remained silent\\r on an adjoining hillside, while the Indians yelled exultantly and ran\\r about in fiendish glee, when Wetzel began the battle by shooting an\\r Indian chieftain who had ventured within range of his ever fatal\\r rifle. And when it came to the heroic deeds of that memorable siege\\r Helen could not contain her enthusiasm. She shed tears over little\\r Harry Bennet's death at the south bastion where, though riddled with\\r bullets, he stuck to his post until relieved. Clark's race, across the\\r roof of the fort to extinguish a burning arrow, she applauded with\\r clapping hands. Her great eyes glowed and burned, but she was silent,\\r when hearing how Wetzel ran alone to a break in the stockade, and\\r there, with an ax, the terrible borderman held at bay the whole\\r infuriated Indian mob until the breach was closed. Lastly Betty Zane's\\r never-to-be-forgotten run with the powder to the relief of the\\r garrison and the saving of the fort was something not to cry over or\\r applaud; but to dream of and to glorify.\",\n",
       " '\"Down that slope from Colonel Zane\\'s cabin is where Betty ran with the\\r powder,\" said Mabel, pointing.',\n",
       " '\"Did you see her?\" asked Helen.',\n",
       " '\"Yes, I looked out of a port-hole. The Indians stopped firing at the\\r fort in their eagerness to shoot Betty. Oh, the banging of guns and\\r yelling of savages was one fearful, dreadful roar! Through all that\\r hail of bullets Betty ran swift as the wind.\"',\n",
       " '\"I almost wish Girty would come again,\" said Helen.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t; he might.\"',\n",
       " '\"How long has Betty\\'s husband, Mr. Clarke, been dead?\" inquired Helen.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t remember exactly. He didn\\'t live long after the siege. Some\\r say he inhaled the flames while fighting fire inside the stockade.\"',\n",
       " '\"How sad!\"',\n",
       " '\"Yes, it was. It nearly killed Betty. But we border girls do not give\\r up easily; we must not,\" replied Mabel, an unquenchable spirit showing\\r through the sadness of her eyes.',\n",
       " \"Merry voices interrupted them, and they turned to see Betty and Nell\\r entering the gate. With Nell's bright chatter and Betty's wit, the\\r conversation became indeed vivacious, running from gossip to gowns,\\r and then to that old and ever new theme, love. Shortly afterward the\\r colonel entered the gate, with swinging step and genial smile.\",\n",
       " '\"Well, now, if here aren\\'t four handsome lasses,\" he said with an\\r admiring glance.',\n",
       " '\"Eb, I believe if you were single any girl might well suspect you of\\r being a flirt,\" said Betty.',\n",
       " '\"No girl ever did. I tell you I was a lady-killer in my day,\" replied\\r Colonel Zane, straightening his fine form. He was indeed handsome,\\r with his stalwart frame, dark, bronzed face and rugged, manly bearing.',\n",
       " '\"Bess said you were; but that it didn\\'t last long after you saw her,\"\\r cried Betty, mischief gleaming in her dark eye.',\n",
       " '\"Well, that\\'s so,\" replied the colonel, looking a trifle crest-fallen;\\r \"but you know every dog has his day.\" Then advancing to the porch, he\\r looked at Mabel with a more serious gaze as he asked, \"How are\\r you to-day?\"',\n",
       " '\"Thank you, Colonel Zane, I am getting quite strong.\"',\n",
       " '\"Look up the valley. There\\'s a raft coming down the river,\" said he\\r softly.',\n",
       " 'Far up the broad Ohio a square patch showed dark against the green\\r water.',\n",
       " 'Colonel Zane saw Mabel start, and a dark red flush came over her pale\\r face. For an instant she gazed with an expression of appeal, almost\\r fear. He knew the reason. Alex Bennet was on that raft.',\n",
       " '\"I came over to ask if I can be of any service?\"',\n",
       " '\"Tell him,\" she answered simply.',\n",
       " '\"I say, Betts,\" Colonel Zane cried, \"has Helen\\'s cousin cast any more\\r such sheep eyes at you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, Eb, what nonsense!\" exclaimed Betty, blushing furiously.',\n",
       " '\"Well, if he didn\\'t look sweet at you I\\'m an old fool.\"',\n",
       " '\"You\\'re one anyway, and you\\'re horrid,\" said Betty, tears of anger\\r glistening in her eyes.',\n",
       " \"Colonel Zane whistled softly as he walked down the lane. He went into\\r the wheelwright's shop to see about some repairs he was having made on\\r a wagon, and then strolled on down to the river. Two Indians were\\r sitting on the rude log wharf, together with several frontiersmen and\\r rivermen, all waiting for the raft. He conversed with the Indians, who\\r were friendly Chippewas, until the raft was tied up. The first person\\r to leap on shore was a sturdy young fellow with a shock of yellow\\r hair, and a warm, ruddy skin.\",\n",
       " '\"Hello, Alex, did you have a good trip?\" asked Colonel Zane of the\\r youth.',\n",
       " '\"H\\'are ye, Colonel Zane. Yes, first-rate trip,\" replied young Bennet.\\r \"Say, I\\'ve a word for you. Come aside,\" and drawing Colonel Zane out\\r of earshot of the others, he continued, \"I heard this by accident, not\\r that I didn\\'t spy a bit when I got interested, for I did; but the way\\r it came about was all chance. Briefly, there\\'s a man, evidently an\\r Englishman, at Fort Pitt whom I overheard say he was out on the border\\r after a Sheppard girl. I happened to hear from one of Brandt\\'s men,\\r who rode into Pitt just before we left, that you had new friends here\\r by that name. This fellow was a handsome chap, no common sort, but\\r lordly, dissipated and reckless as the devil. He had a servant\\r traveling with him, a sailor, by his gab, who was about the toughest\\r customer I\\'ve met in many a day. He cut a fellow in bad shape at Pitt.\\r These two will be on the next boat, due here in a day or so, according\\r to river and weather conditions, an\\' I thought, considerin\\' how\\r unusual the thing was, I\\'d better tell ye.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, well,\" said Colonel Zane reflectively. He recalled Sheppard\\'s\\r talk about an Englishman. \"Alex, you did well to tell me. Was the man\\r drunk when he said he came west after a woman?\"',\n",
       " '\"Sure he was,\" replied Alex. \"But not when he spoke the name. Ye see I\\r got suspicious, an\\' asked about him. It\\'s this way: Jake Wentz, the\\r trader, told me the fellow asked for the Sheppards when he got off the\\r wagon-train. When I first seen him he was drunk, and I heard Jeff Lynn\\r say as how the border was a bad place to come after a woman. That\\'s\\r what made me prick up my ears. Then the Englishman said: \\'It is, eh?\\r By God! I\\'d go to hell after a woman I wanted.\\' An\\' Colonel, he\\r looked it, too.\"',\n",
       " 'Colonel Zane remained thoughtful while Alex made up a bundle and\\r forced the haft of an ax under the string; but as the young man\\r started away the colonel suddenly remembered his errand down to\\r the wharf.',\n",
       " '\"Alex, come back here,\" he said, and wondered if the lad had good\\r stuff in him. The boatman\\'s face was plain, but not evil, and a close\\r scrutiny of it rather prepossessed the colonel.',\n",
       " '\"Alex, I\\'ve some bad news for you,\" and then bluntly, with his keen\\r gaze fastened on the young man\\'s face, he told of old Lane\\'s murder,\\r of Mabel\\'s abduction, and of her rescue by Wetzel.',\n",
       " 'Alex began to curse and swear vengeance.',\n",
       " '\"Stow all that,\" said the colonel sharply. \"Wetzel followed four\\r Indians who had Mabel and some stolen horses. The redskins quarreled\\r over the girl, and two took the horses, leaving Mabel to the others.\\r Wetzel went after these last, tomahawked them, and brought Mabel home.\\r She was in a bad way, but is now getting over the shock.\"',\n",
       " '\"Say, what\\'d we do here without Wetzel?\" Alex said huskily, unmindful\\r of the tears that streamed from his eyes and ran over his brown\\r cheeks. \"Poor old Jake! Poor Mabel! Damn me! it\\'s my fault. If I\\'d \\'a\\r done right an\\' married her as I should, as I wanted to, she wouldn\\'t\\r have had to suffer. But I\\'ll marry her yet, if she\\'ll have me. It was\\r only because I had no farm, no stock, an\\' only that little cabin as is\\r full now, that I waited.\"',\n",
       " '\"Alex, you know me,\" said Colonel Zane in kindly tones. \"Look there,\\r down the clearing half a mile. See that green strip of land along the\\r river, with the big chestnut in the middle and a cabin beyond. There\\'s\\r as fine farming land as can be found on the border, eighty acres, well\\r watered. The day you marry Mabel that farm is yours.\"',\n",
       " 'Alex grew red, stammered, and vainly tried to express his gratitude.',\n",
       " '\"Come along, the sooner you tell Mabel the better,\" said the colonel\\r with glowing face. He was a good matchmaker. He derived more pleasure\\r from a little charity bestowed upon a deserving person, than from a\\r season\\'s crops.',\n",
       " 'When they arrived at the Sheppard house the girls were still on the\\r porch. Mabel rose when she saw Alex, standing white and still. He,\\r poor fellow, was embarrassed by the others, who regarded him with\\r steady eyes.',\n",
       " 'Colonel Zane pushed Alex up on the porch, and said in a low voice:\\r \"Mabel, I\\'ve just arranged something you\\'re to give Alex. It\\'s a nice\\r little farm, and it\\'ll be a wedding present.\"',\n",
       " \"Mabel looked in a bewildered manner from Colonel Zane's happy face to\\r the girls, and then at the red, joyous features of her lover. Only\\r then did she understand, and uttering a strange little cry, put her\\r trembling hands to her bosom as she swayed to and fro.\",\n",
       " 'But she did not fall, for Alex, quick at the last, leaped forward and\\r caught her in his arms.',\n",

       " '\"Where\\'s Will?\" she asked.',\n",
       " '\"Gone after snipe, so he said,\" replied her father.',\n",

       " '\"I\\'m a little homesick,\" Helen replied reluctantly.',\n",
       " '\"No? Well, I declare! This is a glorious country; but not for such as\\r you, dear, who love music and gaiety. I often fear you\\'ll not be happy\\r here, and then I long for the old home, which reminds me of\\r your mother.\"',\n",
       " '\"Dearest, forget what I said,\" cried Helen earnestly. \"I\\'m only a\\r little blue to-day; perhaps not at all homesick.\"',\n",
       " '\"Indeed, you always seemed happy.\"',\n",
       " '\"Father, I am happy. It\\'s only--only a girl\\'s foolish sentiment.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ve got something to tell you, Helen, and it has bothered me since\\r Colonel Zane spoke of it to-night. Mordaunt is coming to Fort Henry.\"',\n",
       " '\"Mordaunt? Oh, impossible! Who said so? How did you learn?\"',\n",
       " '\"I fear \\'tis true, my dear. Colonel Zane told me he had heard of an\\r Englishman at Fort Pitt who asked after us. Moreover, the fellow\\r answers the description of Mordaunt. I am afraid it is he, and come\\r after you.\"',\n",
       " '\"Suppose he has--who cares? We owe him nothing. He cannot hurt us.\"',\n",
       " '\"But, Helen, he\\'s a desperate man. Aren\\'t you afraid of him?\"',\n",
       " '\"Not I,\" cried Helen, laughing in scorn. \"He\\'d better have a care. He\\r can\\'t run things with a high hand out here on the border. I told him I\\r would have none of him, and that ended it.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m much relieved. I didn\\'t want to tell you; but it seemed\\r necessary. Well, child, good night, I\\'ll go to bed.\"',\n",
       " 'Long after Mr. Sheppard had retired Helen sat thinking. Memories of\\r the past, and of the unwelcome suitor, Mordaunt, thronged upon her\\r thick and fast. She could see him now with his pale, handsome face,\\r and distinguished bearing. She had liked him, as she had other men,\\r until he involved her father, with himself, in financial ruin, and had\\r made his attention to her unpleasantly persistent. Then he had\\r followed the fall of fortune with wild dissipation, and became a\\r gambler and a drunkard. But he did not desist in his mad wooing. He\\r became like her shadow, and life grew to be unendurable, until her\\r father planned to emigrate west, when she hailed the news with joy.\\r And now Mordaunt had tracked her to her new home. She was sick with\\r disgust. Then her spirit, always strong, and now freer for this new,\\r wild life of the frontier, rose within her, and she dismissed all\\r thoughts of this man and his passion.',\n",
       " 'The old life was dead and buried. She was going to be happy here. As\\r for the present, it was enough to think of the little border village,\\r now her home; of her girl friends; of the quiet borderman: and, for\\r the moment, that the twilight was somber and beautiful.',\n",
       " 'High up on the wooded bluff rising so gloomily over the village, she\\r saw among the trees something silver-bright. She watched it rise\\r slowly from behind the trees, now hidden, now white through rifts in\\r the foliage, until it soared lovely and grand above the black horizon.\\r The ebony shadows of night seemed to lift, as might a sable mantle\\r moved by invisible hands.

       " \"Mysterious as had grown the night before darkness yielded to the moon,\\r this pale, white light flooding the still valley, was even more soft\\r and strange. To one of Helen's temperament no thought was needed; to\\r see was enough. Yet her mind was active. She felt with haunting power\\r the beauty of all before her; in fancy transporting herself far to\\r those silver-tipped clouds, and peopling the dells and shady nooks\\r under the hills with spirits and fairies, maidens and valiant knights.\\r To her the day was as a far-off dream. The great watch stars grew wan\\r before the radiant moon; it reigned alone.

A borderman lived under the green tree-tops, and,\\r therefore, all the nodding branches of sassafras and laurel, the\\r grassy slopes and rocky cliffs, the stately ash trees, kingly oaks and\\r dark, mystic pines, together with the creatures that dwelt among them,\\r save his deadly red-skinned foes, he loved. Other affection as close\\r and true as this, he had not known. Hearkening thus with single heart\\r to nature's teachings, he learned her secrets. Certain it was,\\r therefore, that the many hours he passed in the woods apart from\\r savage pursuits, were happy and fruitful.\",\n",
       " 'Slowly he pressed on up the ascent, at length coming into open light\\r upon a small plateau marked by huge, rugged, weather-chipped stones.\\r On the eastern side was a rocky promontory, and close to the edge of\\r this cliff, an hundred feet in sheer descent, rose a gnarled, time and\\r tempest-twisted chestnut tree. Here the borderman laid down his rifle\\r and knapsack, and, half-reclining against the tree, settled himself to\\r rest and wait.',\n",
       " 'This craggy point was the lonely watch-tower of eagles. Here on the\\r highest headland for miles around where the bordermen were wont to\\r meet, the outlook was far-reaching and grand.',\n",
       " 'Below the gray, splintered cliffs sheered down to meet the waving\\r tree-tops, and then hill after hill, slope after slope, waved and\\r rolled far, far down to the green river. Open grassy patches, bright\\r little islands in that ocean of dark green, shone on the hillsides.\\r The rounded ridges ran straight, curved, or zigzag, but shaped their\\r graceful lines in the descent to make the valley. Long, purple-hued,\\r shadowy depressions in the wide expanse of foliage marked deep clefts\\r between ridges where dark, cool streams bounded on to meet the river.\\r Lower, where the land was level, in open spaces could be seen a broad\\r trail, yellow in the sunlight, winding along with the curves of the\\r water-course. On a swampy meadow, blue in the distance, a herd of\\r buffalo browsed. Beyond the river, high over the green island, Fort\\r Henry lay peaceful and solitary, the only token of the works of man in\\r all that vast panorama.',\n",
       " \"Jonathan Zane was as much alone as if one thousand miles, instead of\\r five, intervened between him and the settlement. Loneliness was to him\\r a passion.

       " \"Hours here, or in the shady valley, recompensed him for the loss of\\r home comforts, the soft touch of woman's hands, the kiss of baby lips,\\r and also for all he suffered in his pitiless pursuits, the hard fare,\\r the steel and blood of a borderman's life.\",\n",

He listened with\\r his ear close to the ground. Presently he heard a noise as of two hard\\r substances striking together.

       " \"Less than an hour's rapid walking brought him to the river. Here he\\r plunged into a thicket of willows, and emerged on a sandy strip of\\r shore.

       " \"The distance from this point in a straight line to his destination was\\r only a mile; but a rocky bluff and a ravine necessitated his making a\\r wide detour. While lightly leaping over a brook his keen eye fell on\\r an imprint in the sandy loam. Instantly he was on his knees. The\\r footprint was small, evidently a woman's, and, what was more unusual,\\r instead of the flat, round moccasin-track, it was pointed, with a\\r sharp, square heel. Such shoes were not worn by border girls. True\\r Betty and Nell had them; but they never went into the woods without\\r moccasins.\",\n",
       " \"Jonathan's experienced eye saw that this imprint was not an hour old.\\r He gazed up at the light. The day was growing short. Already shadows\\r lay in the glens.

He had not traveled many paces before learning that the\\r one who made it was lost. The uncertainty in those hasty steps was as\\r plain to the borderman's eyes, as if it had been written in words on\\r the sand. The course led along the brook, avoiding the rough places;\\r and leading into the open glades and glens; but it drew no nearer to\\r the settlement. A quarter of an hour of rapid trailing enabled\\r Jonathan to discern a dark figure moving among the trees. Abandoning\\r the trail, he cut across a ridge to head off the lost woman. Stepping\\r out of a sassafras thicket, he came face to face with Helen Sheppard.\",\n",

       " 'Abruptly he turned and walked slowly away. He had no idea of allowing\\r her to go home alone; but believed it might be well for her to think\\r so. If she did not call him back he would remain near at hand, and\\r when she showed signs of anxiety or fear he could go to her.',\n",
       " 'Helen determined she would die in the woods, or be captured by\\r Shawnees, before calling him back. But she watched him.

The gray cloak of twilight was\\r spread over the forest, and in the hollows night already had settled\\r down. A breathless silence pervaded the woods. How lonely! thought\\r Helen, with a shiver. Surely it would be dark before she could find\\r the settlement. What hill hid the settlement from view? She did not\\r know, could not remember which he had pointed out. Suddenly she began\\r to tremble. She had been so frightened before he had found her, and so\\r relieved afterward; and now he was going away.',\n",

Sure enough, one\\'s a lordly Englishman, and the other, the\\r cussedest-looking little chap I ever saw. They started trouble\\r immediately. The Englishman, his name is Mordaunt, hunted up the\\r Sheppards and as near as I can make out from George\\'s story, Helen\\r spoke her mind very plainly. Mordaunt and Case, that\\'s his servant,\\r the little cuss, got drunk and raised hell down at Metzar\\'s where\\r they\\'re staying. Brandt and Williams are drinking hard, too, which is\\r something unusual for Brandt. They got chummy at once with the\\r Englishman, who seems to have plenty of gold and is fond of gambling.\\r This Mordaunt is a gentleman, or I never saw one. I feel sorry for\\r him. He appears to be a ruined man. If he lasts a week out here I\\'ll\\r be surprised. Case looks ugly, as if he were spoiling to cut somebody.\\r I want you to keep your eye peeled. The day may pass off as many other\\r days of drinking bouts have, without anything serious, and on the\\r other hand there\\'s liable to be trouble.\"',\n",
       " \"Jonathan's preparations were characteristic of the borderman. He laid\\r aside his rifle, and, removing his short coat, buckled on a second\\r belt containing a heavier tomahawk and knife than those he had been\\r wearing. Then he put on his hunting frock, or shirt, and wore it loose\\r with the belts underneath, instead of on the outside. Unfastened, the\\r frock was rather full, and gave him the appearance of a man unarmed\\r and careless.\",\n",
       " 'Jonathan Zane was not so reckless as to court danger, nor, like many\\r frontiersmen, fond of fighting for its own sake. Colonel Zane was\\r commandant of the fort, and, in a land where there was no law, tried\\r to maintain a semblance of it. For years he had kept thieves,\\r renegades and outlaws away from his little settlement by dealing out\\r stern justice. His word was law, and his bordermen executed it as\\r such. Therefore Jonathan and Wetzel made it their duty to have a keen\\r eye on all that was happening. They kept the colonel posted, and never\\r interfered in any case without orders.',\n",
       " 'The morning passed quietly. Jonathan strolled here or loitered there;\\r but saw none of the roisterers. He believed they were sleeping off the\\r effects of their orgy on the previous evening. After dinner he smoked\\r his pipe. Betty and Helen passed, and Helen smiled. It struck him\\r suddenly that she had never looked at him in such a way before. There\\r was meaning in that warm, radiant flash. A little sense of vexation,\\r the source of which he did not understand, stirred in him against this\\r girl; but with it came the realization that her white face and big,\\r dark eyes had risen before him often since the night before.

       " 'From beyond the bar-room, through a door entering upon the back porch,\\r came the rattling of dice.

He was a handsome man, with fair skin, and long, silken,\\r blond mustache. Heavy lines, and purple shades under his blue eyes,\\r were die unmistakable stamp of dissipation. Reckless, dissolute, bad\\r as he looked, there yet clung something favorable about the man.\\r Perhaps it was his cool, devil-may-care way as he pushed over gold\\r piece after gold piece from the fast diminishing pile before him.

       " '\"Perhaps not; I couldn\\'t if I were a man. But Jack\\'s not like other\\r people. He\\'d never realize that she cared for him. Besides, he\\'s a\\r borderman.\"',\n",
       " '\"I know, and that\\'s the only serious obstacle. But he could scout\\r around the fort, even if he was married. These long, lonely, terrible\\r journeys taken by him and Wetzel are mostly unnecessary. A sweet wife\\r could soon make him see that. The border will be civilized in a few\\r years, and because of that he\\'d better give over hunting for Indians.\\r I\\'d like to see him married and settled down, like all the rest of us,\\r even Isaac.

       " '\"True, of course it\\'s true, or would be in any man who wasn\\'t as blind\\r as a bat. We\\'ll tell her Jack cares for her; but he is a borderman\\r with stern ideas of duty, and so slow and backward he\\'d never tell his\\r love even if he had overcome his tricks of ranging.

       " '\"Eb, you\\'re a devil,\" said Betty gaily, and then she added in a more\\r sober vein, \"I understand, Eb. Your idea is prompted by love of Jack,\\r and it\\'s all right.

The fair richness of\\r her skin, the perfect lips, the wavy, shiny hair, the wondrous\\r dark-blue, changing eyes, the tall figure, slender, but strong and\\r swelling with gracious womanhood, made a picture he delighted in and\\r loved to have near him. The girl did not possess for him any of that\\r magnetism, so commonly felt by most of her admirers; but he did feel\\r how subtly full she was of something, which for want of a better term\\r he described in Wetzel\\'s characteristic expression, as \"chain-lightning.\"',\n",
       " 'He reflected that as he was so much older, that she, although always\\r winsome and earnest, showed nothing of the tormenting, bewildering\\r coquetry of her nature.

To Betty, Mabel, Nell, and\\r the children, she was frank, girlish, full of fun and always lovable;\\r to her elders quiet and earnestly solicitous to please; to the young\\r men cold; but with a penetrating, mocking promise haunting that\\r coldness, and sometimes sweetly agreeable, often wilful, and\\r changeable as April winds. At last the colonel concluded that she\\r needed, as did all other spirited young women, the taming influence of\\r a man whom she loved, a home to care for, and children to soften and\\r temper her spirit.',\n",
       " '\"Well, young friends, I see you count on keeping the Sabbath,\" he said\\r cheerily. \"For my part, Will, I don\\'t see how Jim Douns can preach\\r this morning, before this laurel blossom and that damask rose.\"',\n",

       " 'The weather gave Helen an excuse which she was not slow to adopt. Her\\r pale face and languid air perplexed and worried her father and her\\r friends. She explained to them that the heat affected her\\r disagreeably.',\n",
       " 'Long days had passed since that Sunday morning when she kissed the\\r borderman. What transports of sweet hope and fear were hers then! How\\r shame had scorched her happiness! Yet still she gloried in the act. By\\r that kiss had she awakened to a full consciousness of her love. With\\r insidious stealth and ever-increasing power this flood had increased\\r to full tide, and, bursting its bonds, surged over her with\\r irresistible strength.',\n",
       " 'During the first days after the dawning of her passion, she lived in\\r its sweetness, hearing only melodious sounds chiming in her soul. The\\r hours following that Sunday were like long dreams. But as all things\\r reach fruition, so this girlish period passed, leaving her a\\r thoughtful woman. She began to gather up the threads of her life where\\r love had broken them, to plan nobly, and to hope and wait.',\n",
       " 'Weeks passed, however, and her lover did not come. Betty told her that\\r Jonathan made flying trips at break of day to hold council with\\r Colonel Zane; that he and Wetzel were on the trail of Shawnees with\\r stolen horses, and both bordermen were in their dark, vengeful,\\r terrible moods. In these later days Helen passed through many stages\\r of feeling. After the exalting mood of hot, young love, came reaction.\\r She fell into the depths of despair. Sorrow paled her face, thinned\\r her cheeks and lent another shadow, a mournful one, to her great eyes.\\r The constant repression of emotion, the strain of trying to seem\\r cheerful when she was miserable, threatened even her magnificent\\r health. She answered the solicitude of her friends by evasion, and\\r then by that innocent falsehood in which a sensitive soul hides its\\r secrets. Shame was only natural, because since the borderman came not,\\r nor sent her a word, pride whispered that she had wooed him,\\r forgetting modesty.',\n",
       " 'Pride, anger, shame, despair, however, finally fled before affection.\\r She loved this wild borderman, and knew he loved her in return\\r although he might not understand it himself. His simplicity, his lack\\r of experience with women, his hazardous life and stern duty regarding\\r it, pleaded for him and for her love. For the lack of a little\\r understanding she would never live unhappy and alone while she was\\r loved. Better give a thousand times more than she had sacrificed. He\\r would return to the village some day, when the Indians and the thieves\\r were run down, and would be his own calm, gentle self. Then she would\\r win him, break down his allegiance to this fearful border life, and\\r make him happy in her love.',\n",
       " 'While Helen was going through one of the fires of life to come out\\r sweeter and purer, if a little pensive and sad, time, which waits not\\r for love, nor life, nor death, was hastening onward, and soon the\\r golden fields of grain were stored. September came with its fruitful\\r promise fulfilled.',\n",
       " \"Helen entered once more into the quiet, social life of the little\\r settlement, taught her class on Sundays, did all her own work, and\\r even found time to bring a ray of sunshine to more than one sick\\r child's bed. Yet she did not forget her compact with Jonathan, and\\r bent all her intelligence to find some clew that might aid in the\\r capture of the horse-thief. She was still groping in the darkness. She\\r could not, however, banish the belief that the traitor was Brandt. She\\r blamed herself for this, because of having no good reasons for\\r suspicion; but the conviction was there, fixed by intuition. Because a\\r man's eyes were steely gray, sharp like those of a cat's, and capable\\r of the same contraction and enlargement, there was no reason to\\r believe their owner was a criminal. But that, Helen acknowledged with\\r a smile, was the only argument she had. To be sure Brandt had looked\\r capable of anything, the night Jonathan knocked him down; she knew he\\r had incited Case to begin the trouble at Metzar's, and had seemed\\r worried since that time. He had not left the settlement on short\\r journeys, as had been his custom before the affair in the bar-room.\\r And not a horse had disappeared from Fort Henry since that time.\",\n",
       " \"Brandt had not discontinued his attentions to her; if they were less\\r ardent it was because she had given him absolutely to understand that\\r she could be his friend only. And she would not have allowed even so\\r much except for Jonathan's plan. She fancied it was possible to see\\r behind Brandt's courtesy, the real subtle, threatening man. Stripped\\r of his kindliness, an assumed virtue, the iron man stood revealed,\\r cold, calculating, cruel.\",\n",
       " 'Mordaunt she never saw but once and then, shocking and pitiful, he lay\\r dead drunk in the grass by the side of the road, his pale, weary,\\r handsome face exposed to the pitiless rays of the sun. She ran home\\r weeping over this wreck of what had once been so fine a gentleman. Ah!\\r the curse of rum! He had learned his soft speech and courtly bearing\\r in the refinement of a home where a proud mother adored, and gentle\\r sisters loved him. And now, far from the kindred he had disgraced, he\\r lay in the road like a log. How it hurt her! She almost wished she\\r could have loved him, if love might have redeemed. She was more kind\\r to her other admirers, more tolerant of Brandt, and could forgive the\\r Englishman, because the pangs she had suffered through love had\\r softened her spirit.',\n",
       " 'During this long period the growing friendship of her cousin for Betty\\r had been a source of infinite pleasure to Helen. She hoped and\\r believed a romance would develop between the young widow and Will, and\\r did all in her power, slyly abetted by the matchmaking colonel, to\\r bring the two together.',\n",
       " \"One afternoon when the sky was clear with that intense blue peculiar\\r to bright days in early autumn, Helen started out toward Betty's,\\r intending to remind that young lady she had promised to hunt for\\r clematis and other fall flowers.\",\n",
       " \"About half-way to Betty's home she met Brandt. He came swinging round\\r a corner with his quick, firm step. She had not seen him for several\\r days, and somehow he seemed different. A brightness, a flash, as of\\r daring expectation, was in his face. The poise, too, of the man\\r had changed.\",\n",
       " '\"Well, I am fortunate. I was just going to your home,\" he said\\r cheerily. \"Won\\'t you come for a walk with me?\"',\n",
       " '\"You may walk with me to Betty\\'s,\" Helen answered.',\n",
       " '\"No, not that. Come up the hillside. We\\'ll get some goldenrod. I\\'d\\r like to have a chat with you. I may go away--I mean I\\'m thinking of\\r making a short trip,\" he added hurriedly.',\n",
       " '\"Please come.\"',\n",
       " '\"I promised to go to Betty\\'s.\"',\n",
       " '\"You won\\'t come?\" His voice trembled with mingled disappointment and\\r resentment.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" Helen replied in slight surprise.',\n",
       " '\"You have gone with the other fellows. Why not with me?\" He was white\\r now, and evidently laboring under powerful feelings that must have had\\r their origin in some thought or plan which hinged on the acceptance of\\r his invitation.',\n",
       " '\"Because I choose not to,\" Helen replied coldly, meeting his glance\\r fully.',\n",
       " \"A dark red flush swelled Brandt's face and neck; his gray eyes gleamed\\r balefully with wolfish glare; his teeth were clenched. He breathed\\r hard and trembled with anger. Then, by a powerful effort, he conquered\\r himself; the villainous expression left his face; the storm of rage\\r subsided. Great incentive there must have been for him thus to repress\\r his emotions so quickly. He looked long at her with sinister, intent\\r regard; then, with the laugh of a desperado, a laugh which might have\\r indicated contempt for the failure of his suit, and which was fraught\\r with a world of meaning, of menace, he left her without so much as\\r a salute.\",\n",
       " \"Helen pondered over this sudden change, and felt relieved because she\\r need make no further pretense of friendship. He had shown himself to\\r be what she had instinctively believed. She hurried on toward Betty's,\\r hoping to find Colonel Zane at home, and with Jonathan, for Brandt's\\r hint of leaving Fort Henry, and his evident chagrin at such a slip of\\r speech, had made her suspicious. She was informed by Mrs. Zane that\\r the colonel had gone to a log-raising; Jonathan had not been in for\\r several days, and Betty went away with Will.\",\n",
       " '\"Where did they go?\" asked Helen.',\n",

       " 'Helen followed the familiar path through the grove of oaks into the\\r glade. It was quite deserted.

Suddenly she was disturbed by the sound of rapid\\r footsteps, and looking up, saw the hulking form of Metzar, the\\r innkeeper, coming down the path. He carried a bucket, and meant\\r evidently to get water. Helen did not desire to be seen, and, thinking\\r he would stay only a moment, slipped into a thicket of willows behind\\r the stone. She could see plainly through the foliage. Metzar came into\\r the glade, peered around in the manner of a man expecting to see some\\r one, and then, filling his bucket at the spring, sat down on\\r the stone.',\n",
       " 'Not a minute elapsed before soft, rapid footsteps sounded in the\\r distance. The bushes parted, disclosing the white, set face and gray\\r eyes of Roger Brandt. With a light spring he cleared the brook and\\r approached Metzar.',\n",
       " 'Before speaking he glanced around the glade with the fugitive,\\r distrustful glance of a man who suspects even the trees. Then,\\r satisfied by the scrutiny he opened his hunting frock, taking forth a\\r long object which he thrust toward Metzar.',\n",

       " '\"Hell!\" gasped Metzar, his dull face quickening with some awful\\r thought.',\n",
       " '\"I guess it is hell,\" replied Brandt, his face growing whiter and\\r wilder.',\n",

       " '\"Up? Man! We haven\\'t a day, maybe less, to shake Fort Henry.\"',\n",
       " '\"What does it mean?\" asked Metzar. He was the calmer of the two.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a signal. The Shawnees, who were in hiding with the horses over\\r by Blueberry swamp, have been flushed by those bordermen. Some of them\\r have escaped; at least one, for no one but Ashbow could shoot that\\r arrow across the river.\"',\n",
       " '\"Suppose he hadn\\'t come?\" whispered Metzar hoarsely.',\n",

       " \"Helen, trembling with horror of what she had heard, raised herself\\r cautiously from the willows where she had lain, and watched the\\r innkeeper's retreating figure. When it had disappeared she gave a\\r little gasp of relief. Free now to run home, there to plan what course\\r must be pursued, she conquered her fear and weakness, and hurried from\\r the glade. Luckily, so far as she was able to tell, no one saw her\\r return. She resolved that she would be cool, deliberate, clever,\\r worthy of the borderman's confidence.\",\n",
       " \"First she tried to determine the purport of this interview between\\r Brandt and Metzar. She recalled to mind all that was said, and\\r supplied what she thought had been suggested. Brandt and Metzar were\\r horse-thieves, aids of Bing Legget. They had repaired to the glade to\\r plan. The Indian had been a surprise. Wetzel had routed the Shawnees,\\r and was now on the trail of this chieftain. The Indian warned them to\\r leave Fort Henry and to meet him at a place called Two Islands.\\r Brandt's plan, presumably somewhat changed by the advent of the\\r red-man, was to steal horses, abduct a girl in broad daylight, and\\r before tomorrow's sunset escape to join the ruffian Legget.\",\n",
       " '\"I am the girl,\" murmured Helen shudderingly, as she relapsed\\r momentarily into girlish fears. But at once she rose above\\r selfish feelings.',\n",
       " \"Secondly, while it was easy to determine what the outlaws meant, the\\r wisest course was difficult to conceive. She had promised the\\r borderman to help him, and not speak of anything she learned to any\\r but himself. She could not be true to him if she asked advice. The\\r point was clear; either she must remain in the settlement hoping for\\r Jonathan's return in time to frustrate Brandt's villainous scheme, or\\r find the borderman. Suddenly she remembered Metzar's allusion to a\\r second person whom Brandt felt certain he could trust. This meant\\r another traitor in Fort Henry, another horse-thief, another desperado\\r willing to make off with helpless women.\",\n",
       " \"Helen's spirit rose in arms. She had their secret, and could ruin\\r them. She would find the borderman.\",\n",
       " 'Wetzel was on the trail at Eagle Rock. What for? Trailing an Indian\\r who was then five miles east of that rock? Not Wetzel! He was on that\\r track to meet Jonathan.

       " '\"I must be calm,\" she said sternly. \"Time is precious. I have not a\\r moment to lose. I will find him. I\\'ve watched that mountain many a\\r time, and can find the trail and the rock. I am in more danger here,\\r than out there in the forest. With Wetzel and Jonathan on the mountain\\r side, the Indians have fled it. But what about the savage who warned\\r Brandt? Let me think. Yes, he\\'ll avoid the river; he\\'ll go round south\\r of the settlement, and, therefore, can\\'t see me cross. How fortunate\\r that I have paddled a canoe many times across the river. How glad that\\r I made Colonel Zane describe the course up the mountains!\"',\n",
       " 'Her resolution fixed, Helen changed her skirt for one of buckskin,\\r putting on leggings and moccasins of the same serviceable material.\\r She filled the pockets of a short, rain-proof jacket with biscuits,\\r and, thus equipped, sallied forth with a spirit and exultation she\\r could not subdue. Only one thing she feared, which was that Brandt or\\r Metzar might see her cross the river. She launched her canoe and\\r paddled down stream, under cover of the bluff, to a point opposite the\\r end of the island, then straight across, keeping the island between\\r her and the settlement. Gaining the other shore, Helen pulled the\\r canoe into the willows, and mounted the bank. A thicket of willow and\\r alder made progress up the steep incline difficult, but once out of it\\r she faced a long stretch of grassy meadowland. A mile beyond began the\\r green, billowy rise of that mountain which she intended to climb.',\n",

       " 'She traversed the whole length of meadowland close under the shadow of\\r the fringed bank, and gained the forest. Here she hesitated. All was\\r so wild and still. No definite course through the woods seemed to\\r invite, and yet all was open. Trees, trees, dark, immovable trees\\r everywhere. The violent trembling of poplar and aspen leaves, when all\\r others were so calm, struck her strangely, and the fearful stillness\\r awed her. Drawing a deep breath she started forward up the gently\\r rising ground.',\n",
       " 'As she advanced the open forest became darker, and of wilder aspect.\\r The trees were larger and closer together. Still she made fair\\r progress without deviating from the course she had determined upon.\\r Before her rose a ridge, with a ravine on either side, reaching nearly\\r to the summit of the mountain. Here the underbrush was scanty, the\\r fallen trees had slipped down the side, and the rocks were not so\\r numerous, all of which gave her reason to be proud, so far, of\\r her judgment.',\n",
       " 'Helen, pressing onward and upward, forgot time and danger, while she\\r reveled in the wonder of the forestland. Birds and squirrels fled\\r before her; whistling and wheezing of alarm, or heavy crashings in the\\r bushes, told of frightened wild beasts. A dull, faint roar, like a\\r distant wind, suggested tumbling waters. A single birch tree, gleaming\\r white among the black trees, enlivened the gloomy forest. Patches of\\r sunlight brightened the shade. Giant ferns, just tinging with autumn\\r colors, waved tips of sculptured perfection. Most wonderful of all\\r were the colored leaves, as they floated downward with a sad,\\r gentle rustle.',\n",
       " 'Helen was brought to a realization of her hazardous undertaking by a\\r sudden roar of water, and the abrupt termination of the ridge in a\\r deep gorge. Grasping a tree she leaned over to look down. It was fully\\r an hundred feet deep, with impassable walls, green-stained and damp,\\r at the bottom of which a brawling, brown brook rushed on its way.\\r Fully twenty feet wide, it presented an insurmountable barrier to\\r further progress in that direction.',\n",
       " \"But Helen looked upon it merely as a difficulty to be overcome. She\\r studied the situation, and decided to go to the left because higher\\r ground was to be seen that way. Abandoning the ridge, she pressed on,\\r keeping as close to the gorge as she dared, and came presently to a\\r fallen tree lying across the dark cleft. Without a second's\\r hesitation, for she knew such would be fatal, she stepped upon the\\r tree and started across, looking at nothing but the log under her\\r feet, while she tried to imagine herself walking across the\\r water-gate, at home in Virginia.\",\n",
       " 'She accomplished the venture without a misstep. When safely on the\\r ground once more she felt her knees tremble and a queer, light feeling\\r came into her head.

       " 'Perilous, if not desperate, work was ahead of her. Broken, rocky\\r ground, matted thicket, and seemingly impenetrable forest, rose darkly\\r in advance. But she was not even tired, and climbed, crawled, twisted\\r and turned on her way upward. She surmounted a rocky ledge, to face a\\r higher ridge covered with splintered, uneven stones, and the fallen\\r trees of many storms. Once she slipped and fell, spraining her wrist.\\r At length this uphill labor began to weary her. To breathe caused a\\r pain in her side and she was compelled to rest.',\n",
       " 'Already the gray light of coming night shrouded the forest. She was\\r surprised at seeing the trees become indistinct; because the shadows\\r hovered over the thickets, and noted that the dark, dim outline of the\\r ridges was fading into obscurity.',\n",
       " 'She struggled on up the uneven slope with a tightening at her heart\\r which was not all exhaustion. For the first time she doubted herself,\\r but it was too late. She could not turn back. Suddenly she felt that\\r she was on a smoother, easier course. Not to strike a stone or break a\\r twig seemed unusual. It might be a path worn by deer going to a\\r spring. Then into her troubled mind flashed the joyful thought, she\\r had found a trail.',\n",
       " 'Soft, wiry grass, springing from a wet soil, rose under her feet. A\\r little rill trickled alongside the trail. Mossy, soft-cushioned stones\\r lay imbedded here and there.

       " 'Helen changed her position from beside the tree, to the hollow under\\r the stone. It was high enough to permit of her sitting upright, and\\r offered a safe retreat from the storm. The bed of leaves was soft and\\r comfortable. She sat there peering out at the darkening heavens.',\n",
       " 'All beneath her, southward and westward was gray twilight. The\\r settlement faded from sight; the river grew wan and shadowy.

       " 'A long swelling moan, sad, low, like the uneasy sigh of the sea,\\r breathed far in the west. It was the wind, the ominous warning of the\\r storm. Sheets of light were now mingled with long, straggling ropes of\\r fire, and the rumblings were often broken by louder, quicker\\r detonations.',\n",
       " \"Then a period, longer than usual, of inky blackness succeeded the\\r sharp flaring of light. A faint breeze ruffled the leaves of the\\r thicket, and fanned Helen's hot cheek. The moan of the wind became\\r more distinct, then louder, and in another instant like the far-off\\r roar of a rushing river. The storm was upon her. Helen shrank closer\\r against the stone, and pulled her jacket tighter around her\\r trembling form.\",\n",
       " 'A sudden, intense, dazzling, blinding, white light enveloped her. The\\r rocky promontory, the weird, giant chestnut tree, the open plateau,\\r and beyond, the stormy heavens, were all luridly clear in the flash of\\r lightning. She fancied it was possible to see a tall, dark figure\\r emerging from the thicket. As the thunderclap rolled and pealed\\r overhead, she strained her eyes into the blackness waiting for the\\r next lightning flash.',\n",
       " 'It came with brilliant, dazing splendor. The whole plateau and thicket\\r were as light as in the day. Close by the stone where she lay crept\\r the tall, dark figure of an Indian. With starting eyes she saw the\\r fringed clothing, the long, flying hair, and supple body peculiar to\\r the savage. He was creeping upon her.',\n",
       " \"Helen's blood ran cold; terror held her voiceless. She felt herself\\r sinking slowly down upon the leaves.\",\n",
       " \"The sun had begun to cast long shadows the afternoon of Helen's hunt\\r for Jonathan, when the borderman, accompanied by Wetzel, led a string\\r of horses along the base of the very mountain she had ascended.\",\n",
       " '\"Last night\\'s job was a good one, I ain\\'t gainsayin\\'; but the redskin\\r I wanted got away,\" Wetzel said gloomily.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s safe now as a squirrel in a hole. I saw him dartin\\' among the\\r trees with his white eagle feathers stickin\\' up like a buck\\'s flag,\"\\r replied Jonathan. \"He can run. If I\\'d only had my rifle loaded! But\\r I\\'m not sure he was that arrow-shootin\\' Shawnee.\"',\n",
       " '\"It was him. I saw his bow. We ought\\'er taken more time an\\' picked him\\r out,\" Wetzel replied, shaking his head gravely. \"Though mebbe that\\'d\\r been useless. I think he was hidin\\'. He\\'s precious shy of his red\\r skin. I\\'ve been after him these ten year, an\\' never ketched him\\r nappin\\' yet. We\\'d have done much toward snuffin\\' out Legget an\\' his\\r gang if we\\'d winged the Shawnee.\"',\n",
       " '\"He left a plain trail.\"',\n",
       " '\"One of his tricks. He\\'s slicker on a trail than any other Injun on\\r the border, unless mebbe it\\'s old Wingenund, the Huron. This Shawnee\\'d\\r lead us many a mile for nuthin\\', if we\\'d stick to his trail. I\\'m long\\r ago used to him. He\\'s doubled like an old fox, run harder\\'n a skeered\\r fawn, an\\', if needs be, he\\'ll lay low as cunnin\\' buck. I calkilate\\r once over the mountain, he\\'s made a bee-line east. We\\'ll go on with\\r the hosses, an\\' then strike across country to find his trail.\"',\n",
       " '\"It \\'pears to me, Lew, that we\\'ve taken a long time in makin\\' a show\\r against these hoss-thieves,\" said Jonathan.',\n",
       " '\"I ain\\'t sayin\\' much; but I\\'ve felt it,\" replied Wetzel.',\n",
       " '\"All summer, an\\' nothin\\' done. It was more luck than sense that we run\\r into those Injuns with the hosses. We only got three out of four, an\\'\\r let the best redskin give us the slip. Here fall is nigh on us, with\\r winter comin\\' soon, an\\' still we don\\'t know who\\'s the white traitor in\\r the settlement.\"',\n",
       " '\"I said it\\'s be a long, an\\' mebbe, our last trail.\"',\n",
       " '\"Why?\"',\n",
       " '\"Because these fellars red or white, are in with a picked gang of the\\r best woodsmen as ever outlawed the border. We\\'ll get the Fort Henry\\r hoss-thief. I\\'ll back the bright-eyed lass for that.\"',\n",
       " '\"I haven\\'t seen her lately, an\\' allow she\\'d left me word if she\\r learned anythin\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"Wal, mebbe it\\'s as well you hain\\'t seen so much of her.\" In silence\\r they traveled and, arriving at the edge of the meadow, were about to\\r mount two of the horses, when Wetzel said in a sharp tone:',\n",
       " '\"Look!\"',\n",
       " 'He pointed to a small, well-defined moccasin track in the black earth\\r on the margin of a rill.',\n",
       " '\"Lew, it\\'s a woman\\'s, sure\\'s you\\'re born,\" declared Jonathan.',\n",
       " 'Wetzel knelt and closely examined the footprint; \"Yes, a woman\\'s, an\\'\\r no Injun.\"',\n",
       " '\"What?\" Jonathan exclaimed, as he knelt to scrutinize the imprint.',\n",
       " '\"This ain\\'t half a day old,\" added Wetzel. \"An\\' not a redskin\\'s\\r moccasin near. What d\\'you reckon?\"',\n",
       " '\"A white girl, alone,\" replied Jonathan as he followed the trail a\\r short distance along the brook. \"See, she\\'s makin\\' upland. Wetzel,\\r these tracks could hardly be my sister\\'s, an\\' there\\'s only one other\\r girl on the border whose feet will match \\'em! Helen Sheppard has\\r passed here, on her way up the mountain to find you or me.\"',\n",
       " '\"I like your reckonin\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"She\\'s suddenly discovered somethin\\', Injuns, hoss-thieves, the Fort\\r Henry traitor, or mebbe, an\\' most likely, some plottin\\'. Bein\\' bound\\r to secrecy by me, she\\'s not told my brother. An\\' it must be call for\\r hurry. She knows we frequent this mountain-top; said Eb told her about\\r the way we get here.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'d calkilate about the same.\"',\n",
       " '\"What\\'ll you do? Go with me after her?\" asked Jonathan.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll take the hosses, an\\' be at the fort inside of an hour. If\\r Helen\\'s gone, I\\'ll tell her father you\\'re close on her trail. Now\\r listen! It\\'ll be dark soon, an\\' a storm\\'s comin\\'. Don\\'t waste time on\\r her trail. Hurry up to the rock. She\\'ll be there, if any lass could\\r climb there. If not, come back in the mornin\\', hunt her trail out, an\\'\\r find her. I\\'m thinkin\\', Jack, we\\'ll find the Shawnee had somethin\\' to\\r do with this. Whatever happens after I get back to the fort, I\\'ll\\r expect you hard on my trail.\"',\n",
       " 'Jonathan bounded across the brook and with an easy lope began the\\r gradual ascent. Soon he came upon a winding path. He ran along this\\r for perhaps a quarter of an hour, until it became too steep for rapid\\r traveling, when he settled down to a rapid walk. The forest was\\r already dark. A slight rustling of the leaves beneath his feet was the\\r only sound, except at long intervals the distant rumbling of thunder.',\n",
       " \"The mere possibility of Helen's being alone on that mountain seeking\\r him, made Jonathan's heart beat as it never had before. For weeks he\\r had avoided her, almost forgot her. He had conquered the strange,\\r yearning weakness which assailed him after that memorable Sunday, and\\r once more the silent shaded glens, the mystery of the woods, the\\r breath of his wild, free life had claimed him. But now as this\\r evidence of her spirit, her recklessness, was before him, and he\\r remembered Betty's avowal, a pain, which was almost physical, tore at\\r his heart. How terrible it would be if she came to her death through\\r him! He pictured the big, alluring eyes, the perfect lips, the\\r haunting face, cold in death. And he shuddered.\",\n",
       " 'The dim gloom of the woods soon darkened into blackness. The flashes\\r of lightning, momentarily streaking the foliage, or sweeping overhead\\r in pale yellow sheets, aided Jonathan in keeping the trail.',\n",

Wetzel had routed the Shawnees, and was now on the trail of this chieftain. The Indian warned them to leave Fort Henry and to meet him at a place called Two Islands.

All the more did they feel sure of this conclusion because the bordermen never spoke of their deeds. Sometimes a pioneer living on the outskirts of the settlement would be awakened in the morning by a single rifle shot, and on peering out would see a dead Indian lying almost across his doorstep, while beyond, in the dim, gray mist, a tall figure stealing away. Often in the twilight on a summer evening, while fondling his children and enjoying his smoke after a hard day's labor in the fields, this same settler would see the tall, dark figure of Jonathan Zane step noiselessly out of a thicket, and learn that he must take his family and flee at once to the fort for safety. When a settler was murdered, his children carried into captivity by Indians, and the wife given over to the power of some brutal renegade, tragedies wofully frequent on the border, Wetzel and Jonathan took the trail alone. Many a white woman was returned alive and, sometimes, unharmed to her relatives; more than one maiden lived to be captured, rescued, and returned to her lover, while almost numberless were the bones of brutal redmen lying in the deep and gloomy woods, or bleaching on the plains, silent, ghastly reminders of the stern justice meted out by these two heroes.\n",

More than that, a lively interest had been aroused in her. This borderman was to her a new and novel character. She was amused at learning that here was a young man absolutely indifferent to the charms of the opposite sex, and although hardly admitting such a thing, she believed it would be possible to win him from his indifference. On raising her eyelids, it was with the unconcern which a woman feigns when suspecting she is being regarded with admiring eyes.

She recalled her unbounded enthusiasm for the man as Colonel Zane had told of him; then her first glimpse, and her surprise and admiration at the lithe-limbed young giant; then incredulity, amusement, and respect followed in swift order, after which an unaccountable coldness that was almost resentment. Helen was forced to admit that she did not know how to regard him, but surely he was a man, throughout every inch of his superb frame, and one who took life seriously, with neither thought nor time for the opposite sex. And this last brought a blush to her cheek, for she distinctly remembered she had expected, if not admiration, more than passing notice from this hero of the border.\n",

In the morning he sometimes lay with Colonel Zane's dog, Chief, by the side of a spring under an elm tree, and in the afternoon strolled aimlessly along the river bluff, or on the hillside. At night he sat on his brother's porch smoking a long Indian pipe.

He could not keep her a prisoner long while Jonathan Zane and Wetzel were free to take his trail. What were his intentions? Where was he taking her? Such questions as these, however, troubled Helen more than a little. They brought her thoughts back to the Indians leading the way with lithe and stealthy step. How had Mordaunt associated himself with these savages? Then, suddenly, it dawned upon her that Brandt also might be in this scheme to carry her off. She scouted the idea; but it returned.

Then he put on his hunting frock, or shirt, and wore it loose with the belts underneath, instead of on the outside. Unfastened, the frock was rather full, and gave him the appearance of a man unarmed and careless.\n",

      "Jonathan Zane was not so reckless as to court danger, nor, like many frontiersmen, fond of fighting for its own sake. Colonel Zane was commandant of the fort, and, in a land where there was no law, tried to maintain a semblance of it. For years he had kept thieves, renegades and outlaws away from his little settlement by dealing out stern justice. His word was law, and his bordermen executed it as such. Therefore Jonathan and Wetzel made it their duty to have a keen eye on all that was happening. They kept the colonel posted, and never interfered in any case without orders.\n",

After dinner he smoked his pipe. Betty and Helen passed, and Helen smiled. It struck him suddenly that she had never looked at him in such a way before. There was meaning in that warm, radiant flash. A little sense of vexation, the source of which he did not understand, stirred in him against this girl; but with it came the realization that her white face and big, dark eyes had risen before him often since the night before. He wished, for the first time, that he could understand women better.\n",

The player sitting next to Brandt was Williams, one of the garrison, and a good-natured fellow, but garrulous and wickedly disposed when drunk. The remaining player Jonathan at once saw was the Englishman, Mordaunt. He was a handsome man, with fair skin, and long, silken, blond mustache. Heavy lines, and purple shades under his blue eyes, were die unmistakable stamp of dissipation. Reckless, dissolute, bad as he looked, there yet clung something favorable about the man. Perhaps it was his cool, devil-may-care way as he pushed over gold piece after gold piece from the fast diminishing pile before him.

In these later days Helen passed through many stages of feeling. After the exalting mood of hot, young love, came reaction. She fell into the depths of despair. Sorrow paled her face, thinned her cheeks and lent another shadow, a mournful one, to her great eyes. The constant repression of emotion, the strain of trying to seem cheerful when she was miserable, threatened even her magnificent health. She answered the solicitude of her friends by evasion, and then by that innocent falsehood in which a sensitive soul hides its secrets.

We must protect ourselves, and above all our women.

Simon Girty took McKee and Elliott, the Tories, from Fort Pitt, when he deserted, and ten men besides. They're all, except those who are dead, outlaws of the worst type. The other bad men drifted out here from Lord only knows where. They're scattered all over. Simon Girty, since his crowning black deed, the massacre of the Christian Indians, is in hiding. Bing Legget now has the field. He's a hard nut, a cunning woodsman, and capable leader who surrounds himself with only the most desperate Indians and renegades.

Branches of young maples had been broken by the borderman; they were glaring evidences of his passage. On open ground, or through swampy meadows he had contrived to leave other means to facilitate his comrade's progress.

It was a heavy growth of hardwood trees, interspersed with slender ash and maples, which with their scanty foliage resembled a labyrinth of green and yellow network, like filmy dotted lace, hung on the taller, darker oaks. Jonathan felt safer in this deep wood. He could still see several rods in advance. Following the trail, he was relieved to see that Wetzel's leaps had become shorter and shorter, until they once again were about the length of a long stride. The borderman was, moreover, swinging in a curve to the northeast. This was proof that the borderman had not been pursued, but was making a wide detour to get ahead of the enemy.

It was like the melancholy cry of an oriole, short, deep, suggestive of lonely forest dells. By a slight variation in the short call, Jonathan recognized it as a signal from Wetzel. The borderman smiled as he realized that with all his stealth, Wetzel had heard or seen him re-enter the grove. The signal was a warning to stand still or retreat.\n",

With one exception, they all had straight trunks. This deviated from the others in that it possessed an irregular, bulging trunk, or else half-shielded the form of Wetzel. So indistinct and immovable was this irregularity, that the watcher could not be certain. Out of line, somewhat, with this tree which he suspected screened his comrade, lay a huge windfall large enough to conceal in ambush a whole band of savages.\n",

A feathered arrow had pinned his shoulder to the tree. He raised his hand to pull it out; but, slippery with blood, it afforded a poor hold for his fingers. Violently exerting himself, with both hands he wrenched away the weapon. The flint-head lacerating his flesh and scraping his shoulder bones caused sharpest agony. The pain gave away to a sudden sense of giddiness; he tried to run; a dark mist veiled his sight; he stumbled and fell. Then he seemed to sink into a great darkness, and knew no more.\n",

He turned his head, and saw that he was in a sort of amphitheater of about two acres in extent enclosed by low cliffs. A cleft in the stony wall let out a brawling brook, and served, no doubt, as entrance to the place. Several rude log cabins stood on that side of the enclosure.

Their naked, muscular bodies were painted for the war-path with their strange emblems of death. A trio of white men, nearly as bronzed as their savage comrades, completed the group. One, a desperate-looking outlaw, Jonathan did not know. The blond-bearded giant in the center was Legget. Steel-blue, inhuman eyes, with the expression of a free but hunted animal; a set, mastiff-like jaw, brutal and coarse, individualized him. The last man was the haggard-faced Brandt.\n",

In a corral near the entrance, he saw a number of fine horses, and among them his sister's pony. A more inaccessible, natural refuge than Legget's, could hardly have been found in that country. The entrance was a narrow opening in the wall, and could be held by half a dozen against an army of besiegers.

The Delaware villages lay far to the north; the Wyandot to the west. No likelihood was there of falling in with a band of Indians hunting, because this region, stony, barren, and poorly watered, afforded sparse pasture for deer or bison. From the prisoner's point of view this enterprise of Ashbow's was reckless and vainglorious. Cunning as the chief was, he erred in one point, a great warrior's only weakness, love of show, of pride, of his achievement. In Indian nature this desire for fame was as strong as love of life. The brave risked everything to win his eagle feathers, and the matured warrior found death while keeping bright the glory of the plumes he had won.\n",

This meant, whether Brandt was dead or not, that the fighting strength of her captors had been diminished.

Wetzel had his moments of frenzied joy, but they passed with the echo of his vengeful yell. Jonathan's happiness, such as it was, had been to roam the forests. That, before a woman's eyes had dispelled it, had been enough, and compensated him for the gloomy, bloody phantoms which haunted him.\n",

They knew full well it would be difficult to throw this wolf off the scent; understood that if any attempt was made to ambush the trail, they must cope with woodcraft keener than an Indian's. Flying in desperation, they hoped to reach the rocky retreat, where, like foxes in their burrows, they believed themselves safe.\n",

Here he saw in this last ground no indication of his comrade's trail; nothing was to be seen save the imprints of the horses' hoofs. Jonathan halted behind the nearest underbrush.

The Englishman, his name is Mordaunt, hunted up the Sheppards and as near as I can make out from George's story, Helen spoke her mind very plainly. Mordaunt and Case, that's his servant, the little cuss, got drunk and raised hell down at Metzar's where they're staying. Brandt and Williams are drinking hard, too, which is something unusual for Brandt. They got chummy at once with the Englishman, who seems to have plenty of gold and is fond of gambling. This Mordaunt is a gentleman, or I never saw one. I feel sorry for him. He appears to be a ruined man. If he lasts a week out here I'll be surprised.

There was high jinks over at Metzar's place yesterday, and I'm looking for more to-day. The two fellows Alex Bennet told me about, came on day-before-yesterday's boat. Sure enough, one's a lordly Englishman, and the other, the cussedest-looking little chap I ever saw. They started trouble immediately. The Englishman, his name is Mordaunt, hunted up the Sheppards and as near as I can make out from George's story, Helen spoke her mind very plainly. Mordaunt and Case, that's his servant, the little cuss, got drunk and raised hell down at Metzar's where they're staying. Brandt and Williams are drinking hard, too, which is something unusual for Brandt. They got chummy at once with the Englishman, who seems to have plenty of gold and is fond of gambling. This Mordaunt is a gentleman, or I never saw one. I feel sorry for him. He appears to be a ruined man. If he lasts a week out here I'll be surprised. Case looks ugly, as if he were spoiling to cut somebody. I want you to keep your eye peeled. The day may pass off as many other days of drinking bouts have, without anything serious, and on the other hand there's liable to be trouble.\"\n",

      "The mere possibility of Helen's being alone on that mountain seeking him, made Jonathan's heart beat as it never had before. For weeks he had avoided her, almost forgot her. He had conquered the strange, yearning weakness which assailed him after that memorable Sunday, and once more the silent shaded glens, the mystery of the woods, the breath of his wild, free life had claimed him. But now as this evidence of her spirit, her recklessness, was before him, and he remembered Betty's avowal, a pain, which was almost physical, tore at his heart. How terrible it would be if she came to her death through him! He pictured the big, alluring eyes, the perfect lips, the haunting face, cold in death. And he shuddered.\n",

She was alone on a wild mountain, in the night, with this borderman, the one she loved. By chance and her own foolhardiness this had come about, yet she was fortunate to have it tend to some good beyond her own happiness. All she would suffer from her perilous climb would be aching bones, and, perhaps, a scolding from her father. What she might gain was more than she had dared hope. The breaking up of the horse-thief gang would be a boon to the harassed settlement. How proudly Colonel Zane would smile! Her name would go on that long roll of border honor and heroism.

The long, swelling slope lay clear to the sunshine. With the rays of the sun gleaming and glistening upon the variegated foliage, and upon the shiny rolling haze above, a beautiful picture of autumn splendor was before her. Tall pines, here and there towered high and lonely over the surrounding trees. Their dark, green, graceful heads stood in bold relief above the gold and yellow crests beneath.

I never saw Wetzel so implacable, nor Jonathan so fatally cold but once, and that was when Miller, another traitor, much like Brandt, tried to make away with Betty. It would have chilled your blood to see Wetzel go at that fool this morning. Why did he want to pull a knife on the borderman? It was a sad sight. Well, these things are justifiable. We must protect ourselves, and above all our women. We've had bad men, and a bad man out here is something you cannot yet appreciate, come here and slip into the life of the settlement, because on the border you can never tell what a man is until he proves himself. There have been scores of criminals spread over the frontier, and some better men, like Simon Girty, who were driven to outlaw life. Simon must not be confounded with Jim Girty, absolutely the most fiendish desperado who ever lived. Why, even the Indians feared Jim so much that after his death his skeleton remained unmolested in the glade where he was killed. The place is believed to be haunted now, by all Indians and many white hunters, and I believe the bones stand there yet.\"\n",

And when it came to the heroic deeds of that memorable siege Helen could not contain her enthusiasm. She shed tears over little Harry Bennet's death at the south bastion where, though riddled with bullets, he stuck to his post until relieved. Clark's race, across the roof of the fort to extinguish a burning arrow, she applauded with clapping hands. Her great eyes glowed and burned, but she was silent, when hearing how Wetzel ran alone to a break in the stockade, and there, with an ax, the terrible borderman held at bay the whole infuriated Indian mob until the breach was closed. Lastly Betty Zane's never-to-be-forgotten run with the powder to the relief of the garrison and the saving of the fort was something not to cry over or applaud; but to dream of and to glorify.\n",

The colonel had said that the man was prosperous for an innkeeper who took pelts, grain or meat in exchange for rum. The village gossips disliked him because he was unmarried, taciturn, and did not care for their company. Jonathan reflected also on the fact that Indians were frequently coming to the inn, and this made him distrustful of the proprietor. It was true that Colonel Zane had red-skinned visitors, but there was always good reason for their coming. Jonathan had seen, during the Revolution, more than one trusted man proven to be a traitor, and the conviction settled upon him that some quiet scouting would show up the innkeeper as aiding the horse-thieves if not actually in league with them.\n",

Sure enough, one's a lordly Englishman, and the other, the cussedest-looking little chap I ever saw. They started trouble immediately. The Englishman, his name is Mordaunt, hunted up the Sheppards and as near as I can make out from George's story, Helen spoke her mind very plainly. Mordaunt and Case, that's his servant, the little cuss, got drunk and raised hell down at Metzar's where they're staying. Brandt and Williams are drinking hard, too, which is something unusual for Brandt. They got chummy at once with the Englishman, who seems to have plenty of gold and is fond of gambling. This Mordaunt is a gentleman, or I never saw one. I feel sorry for him. He appears to be a ruined man. If he lasts a week out here I'll be surprised. Case looks ugly, as if he were spoiling to cut somebody. I want you to keep your eye peeled.

      "Helen gazed upon this company with mingled feelings of relief and pleasure. She had been more concerned regarding the young people with whom her lot might be cast, than the dangers of which others had told. She knew that on the border there was no distinction of rank. Though she came of an old family, and, during her girlhood, had been surrounded by refinement, even luxury, she had accepted cheerfully the reverses of fortune, and was determined to curb the pride which had been hers. It was necessary she should have friends. Warm-hearted, impulsive and loving, she needed to have around her those in whom she could confide. Therefore it was with sincere pleasure she understood how groundless were her fears and knew that if she did not find good, true friends the fault would be her own. She saw at a glance that the colonel's widowed sister was her equal, perhaps her superior, in education and breeding, while Nellie Douns was as well-bred and gracious a little lady as she had ever met. Then, the other girls, too, were charming, with frank wholesomeness and freedom.\n",

I never saw Wetzel so implacable, nor Jonathan so fatally cold but once, and that was when Miller, another traitor, much like Brandt, tried to make away with Betty. It would have chilled your blood to see Wetzel go at that fool this morning. Why did he want to pull a knife on the borderman? It was a sad sight. Well, these things are justifiable. We must protect ourselves, and above all our women. We've had bad men, and a bad man out here is something you cannot yet appreciate, come here and slip into the life of the settlement, because on the border you can never tell what a man is until he proves himself. There have been scores of criminals spread over the frontier, and some better men, like Simon Girty, who were driven to outlaw life. Simon must not be confounded with Jim Girty, absolutely the most fiendish desperado who ever lived. Why, even the Indians feared Jim so much that after his death his skeleton remained unmolested in the glade where he was killed. The place is believed to be haunted now, by all Indians and many white hunters, and I believe the bones stand there yet.\"\n",

And when it came to the heroic deeds of that memorable siege Helen could not contain her enthusiasm. She shed tears over little Harry Bennet's death at the south bastion where, though riddled with bullets, he stuck to his post until relieved. Clark's race, across the roof of the fort to extinguish a burning arrow, she applauded with clapping hands. Her great eyes glowed and burned, but she was silent, when hearing how Wetzel ran alone to a break in the stockade, and there, with an ax, the terrible borderman held at bay the whole infuriated Indian mob until the breach was closed.

He had learned his soft speech and courtly bearing in the refinement of a home where a proud mother adored, and gentle sisters loved him. And now, far from the kindred he had disgraced, he lay in the road like a log. How it hurt her! She almost wished she could have loved him, if love might have redeemed.
