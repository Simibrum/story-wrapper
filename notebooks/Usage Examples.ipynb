      "In the latter part of the seventeenth century, there was a young\r\n",
      "blacksmith in our part of the country named Josiah Spencer. He had a\r\n",
      "quick eye, a quick hand and a quicker temper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Because of his quick eye he married a girl named Mary McMillan. Because\r\n",
      "of his quick hand, he was never in need of employment. And because of his\r\n",
      "quick temper, he left the place of his birth one day and travelled west\r\n",
      "until he came to a ford which crossed the Quinebaug River.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There, before the week was over, he had bought from Oeneko, the Indian\r\n",
      "chief, five hundred acres on each side of the river--land in those days\r\n",
      "being the cheapest known commodity. Hewing his own timber and making his\r\n",
      "own hardware, he soon built a shop of his own, and the ford being on the\r\n",
      "main road between Hartford and the Providence Plantations, it wasn't long\r\n",
      "before he had plenty of business.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Above the ford was a waterfall. Josiah put in a wheel, a grist mill and a\r\n",
      "saw mill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By that time Mary, his wife, had presented him with one of the two\r\n",
      "greatest gifts that a woman can ever bestow, and presently a sign was\r\n",
      "painted over the shop:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "JOSIAH SPENCER & SON\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In course of time young Josiah made his first horse-shoe and old Josiah\r\n",
      "made his last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On a visit to New Amsterdam, the young man had already fallen in love\r\n",
      "with a girl named Matilda Sturtevant. They were married in 1746 and had\r\n",
      "one of those round old-fashioned families when twelve children seemed to\r\n",
      "be the minimum and anything less created comment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two of the boys were later killed in the Revolution, another became\r\n",
      "Supreme Court justice, but the likeliest one succeeded to the business of\r\n",
      "Josiah Spencer & Son, which was then making a specialty of building\r\n",
      "wagons--and building them so well that the shop had to be increased in\r\n",
      "size again and again until it began to have the appearance of quite a\r\n",
      "respectable looking factory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The third Spencer to own the business married a Yankee--Patience\r\n",
      "Babcock--but Patience's only son married a French-Canadian girl--for even\r\n",
      "then the Canadians were drifting down into our part of the country.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So by that time, as you can see--and this is an important part of my\r\n",
      "preface--the Spencer stock was a thrifty mixture of Yankee, Irish,\r\n",
      "Scotch, Dutch and French blood--although you would never have guessed it\r\n",
      "if you had simply seen the name of one Josiah Spencer following another\r\n",
      "as the owner of the Quinebaug Wagon Works.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the same year that the fourth Josiah Spencer succeeded to the\r\n",
      "business, a bridge was built to take the place of the ford and the\r\n",
      "waterfall was fortified by a dam. By that time a regular little town had\r\n",
      "formed around the factory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The town was called New Bethel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was at this stage of their history that the Spencers grew proud,\r\n",
      "making a hobby of their family tree and even possibly breathing a sigh\r\n",
      "over vanished coats-of-arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fifth of the line, for instance, married a Miss Copleigh of Boston.\r\n",
      "He built a big house on Bradford Hill and brought her home in a tally-ho.\r\n",
      "The number of her trunks and the size of her crinolines are spoken of to\r\n",
      "this day in our part of the country--also her manner of closing her eyes\r\n",
      "when she talked, and holding her little finger at an angle when drinking\r\n",
      "her tea. She had only one child--fortunately a son.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This son was the grandfather of our heroine. So you see we are getting\r\n",
      "warm at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grandfather of our heroine was probably the greatest Spencer of them\r\n",
      "all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under his ownership the factory was rebuilt of brick and stone. He\r\n",
      "developed the town both socially and industrially until New Bethel bade\r\n",
      "fair to become one of the leading cities in the state. He developed the\r\n",
      "water power by building a great dam above the factory and forming a lake\r\n",
      "nearly ten miles long. He also developed an artillery wheel which has\r\n",
      "probably rolled along every important road in the civilized world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Indeed he was so engaged in these enterprises that he didn't marry until\r\n",
      "he was well past forty-five. Then one spring, going to Charlestown to buy\r\n",
      "his season's supply of pine, he came back with a bride from one of the\r\n",
      "oldest, one of the most famous families in all America.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were three children to this marriage--one son and two daughters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I will tell you about the daughters in my first chapter--two delightful\r\n",
      "old maids who later had a baby between them--but first I must tell you\r\n",
      "about the seventh and last Josiah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In his youth he was wild.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This may have been partly due to that irreducible minimum of Original Sin\r\n",
      "which (they say) is in all of us--and partly due to his cousin Stanley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now I don't mean to say for a moment that Stanley Woodward was a natural\r\n",
      "born villain. I don't think people are born that way at all. At first the\r\n",
      "idea probably struck him as a sort of a joke. \"If anything happens to\r\n",
      "young Josiah,\" I can imagine him thinking to himself with a grin, \"I may\r\n",
      "own this place myself some day.... Who knows?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And from that day forward, he unconsciously borrowed from the spiders--if\r\n",
      "you can imagine a smiling spider--and began to spin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Did young Josiah want to leave the office early? Stanley smilingly did\r\n",
      "his work for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was young Josiah late the next morning? Stanley smilingly hid his\r\n",
      "absence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Did young Josiah yearn for life and adventure? Stanley spun a few more\r\n",
      "webs and they met that night in Brigg's livery stable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It didn't take much of this--unexpectedly little in fact--the last of the\r\n",
      "Spencers resembling one of those giant firecrackers of bygone days--the\r\n",
      "bigger the cracker, the shorter the fuse. Some say he married an actress,\r\n",
      "which was one of the things which were generally whispered when I was a\r\n",
      "boy. A Russian they said she was--which never failed to bring another\r\n",
      "gasp. Others say she was a beautiful bare-back rider in a circus and wore\r\n",
      "tights--which was another of the things which used to be whispered when I\r\n",
      "was a boy, and not even then unless the children had first been sent from\r\n",
      "the room and only bosom friends were present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whatever she was, young Josiah disappeared with her, and no one saw him\r\n",
      "again until his mother died in the mansion on the hill. Some say she died\r\n",
      "of a broken heart, but I never believed in that, for if sorrow could\r\n",
      "break the human heart I doubt if many of us would be alive to smile at\r\n",
      "next year's joys. However that may be, I do believe that young Josiah\r\n",
      "thought that he was partly responsible for his mother's death. He turned\r\n",
      "up at the funeral with a boy seven years old; and bit by bit we learned\r\n",
      "that he was separated from his wife and that the court had given him\r\n",
      "custody of their only child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As you have probably noticed, there are few who can walk so straight as\r\n",
      "those who have once been saved from the crooked path. There are few so\r\n",
      "intolerant of fire as those poor, charred brands who have once been\r\n",
      "snatched from the burning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After his mother's funeral young Spencer settled down to a life of\r\n",
      "atonement and toil, till first his father and then even his cousin\r\n",
      "Stanley were convinced of the change which had taken place in the\r\n",
      "one-time black sheep of the family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By that time the patents on the artillery wheel had expired and a\r\n",
      "competition had set in which was cutting down the profits to zero. Young\r\n",
      "Josiah began experimenting on a new design which finally resulted in a\r\n",
      "patent upon a combination ball and roller bearing. This was such an\r\n",
      "improvement upon everything which had gone before, that gradually Spencer\r\n",
      "& Son withdrew from the manufacture of wagons and wheels and re-designed\r\n",
      "their whole factory to make bearings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This wasn't done in a month or two, nor even in a year or two. Indeed the\r\n",
      "returned prodigal grew middle aged in the process. He also saw the\r\n",
      "possibilities of harnessing the water power above the factory to make\r\n",
      "electric current. This current was sold so cheaply that more and more\r\n",
      "factories were drawn to New Bethel until the fame of the city's products\r\n",
      "were known wherever the language of commerce was spoken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the height of his son's success, old Josiah died, joining those silent\r\n",
      "members of the firm who had gone before. I often like to imagine the\r\n",
      "whole seven of them, ghostly but inquisitive, following the subsequent\r\n",
      "strange proceedings with noiseless steps and eyes that missed nothing;\r\n",
      "and in particular keeping watch upon the last living Josiah Spencer--a\r\n",
      "heavy, powerfully built man with a look of melancholy in his eyes and a\r\n",
      "way of sighing to himself as though asking a question, and then answering\r\n",
      "it with a muffled \"Yes... Yes...\" This may have been partly due to the\r\n",
      "past and partly due to the future, for the son whom he had brought home\r\n",
      "with him began to worry him--a handsome young rascal who simply didn't\r\n",
      "have the truth in him at times, and who was buying presents for girls\r\n",
      "almost before he was out of short trousers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His name was Paul--\"Paul Vionel Olgavitch Spencer,\" he sometimes proudly\r\n",
      "recited it, and whenever we heard of that we thought of his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The older Paul grew, the handsomer he grew. And the handsomer he grew,\r\n",
      "the wilder he became and the less the truth was in him. At times he would\r\n",
      "go all right for a while, although he was always too fond of the river\r\n",
      "for his aunts' peace of mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a bend below the dam he had found a sheltered basin, covered with\r\n",
      "grass and edged with trees. And there he liked to lie, staring up into\r\n",
      "the sky and dreaming those dreams of youth and adventure which are the\r\n",
      "heritage of us all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Or else he would sit and watch the river, although he couldn't do it\r\n",
      "long, for its swift movement seemed to fascinate him and excite him, and\r\n",
      "to arouse in him the desire to follow it--to follow it wherever it went.\r\n",
      "These were his quieter moods.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ordinarily there was something gipsy-like, something Neck-or-Nothing\r\n",
      "about him. A craving for excitement seemed to burn under him like a fire.\r\n",
      "The full progression of correction marched upon him and failed to make\r\n",
      "impression: arguments, orders, warnings, threats, threshings and the\r\n",
      "stoppage of funds: none of these seemed to improve him in the least.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Josiah's two sisters did their best, but they could do nothing, either.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wouldn't whip him again, Josiah,\" said Miss Cordelia one night,\r\n",
      "timidly laying her hand upon her brother's arm. \"He'll be all right when\r\n",
      "he's a little older.... You know, dear ... you were rather wild, yourself\r\n",
      "... when you were young.... Patty and I were only saying this morning\r\n",
      "that if he takes after you, there's really nothing to worry about--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's God's own punishment,\" said Josiah, looking up wildly. \"I\r\n",
      "know--things I can't tell you. You remember what I say: that boy will\r\n",
      "disgrace us all....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning he suddenly and simply vanished with the factory pay-roll and\r\n",
      "one of the office stenographers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the next twelve months Josiah seemed to age at least twelve years--his\r\n",
      "cousin Stanley watching him closely the while--and then one day came the\r\n",
      "news that Paul Spencer had shot and killed a man, while attempting to\r\n",
      "hold him up, somewhere in British Columbia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you could have seen Josiah Spencer that day you might have thought\r\n",
      "that the bullet had grazed his own poor heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's God's punishment,\" he said over and over. \"For seven generations\r\n",
      "there has been a Spencer & Son--a trust that was left to me by my father\r\n",
      "that I should pass it on to my son. And what have I done...!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whereupon he made a gesture that wasn't far from despair--and in that\r\n",
      "gesture, such as only those can make who know in their hearts that they\r\n",

      "over to her sister and said (though somewhat out of breath) \"Isn't it\r\n",
      "nice!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This, of course, was all strictly private.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In public, Mary was brought up with maidenly deportment. You would never\r\n",
      "dream, for instance, that she was ever tickled with a turkey feather\r\n",
      "(which Miss Cordelia kept for the purpose) or that she had ever been\r\n",
      "atomized all over with Lily of the Valley (which Miss Patty never did\r\n",
      "again because Ma'm Maynard, the old French nurse, smelled it and told the\r\n",
      "maids). But always deep down in the child was an indefinable quality\r\n",
      "which puzzled her two aunts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Mary grew older, this quality became clearer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know what it is,\" said Miss Cordelia one night. \"She has a mind of her\r\n",
      "own. Everything she sees or hears: she tries to reason it out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can't tell you why, but Miss Patty looked uneasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only this morning,\" continued Miss Cordelia, \"I heard Ma'm Maynard\r\n",
      "telling her that there wasn't a prettier syringa bush anywhere than the\r\n",
      "one under her bedroom window. Mary turned to her with those eyes of\r\n",
      "hers--you know the way she does--'Ma'm Maynard,' she said, 'have you seen\r\n",
      "all the other s'inga bushes in the world?' And only yesterday I said to\r\n",
      "her, 'Mary, you shouldn't try to whistle. It isn't nice.' She gave me\r\n",
      "that look--you know--and said, 'Then let us learn to whistle, Aunt\r\n",
      "T'delia, and help to make it nice.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Imagine you and I saying things like that when we were girls,\" said Miss\r\n",
      "Patty, still looking troubled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, I know. And yet... I sometimes think that if you and I had\r\n",
      "been brought up a little differently....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were both quiet then for a time, each consulting her memories of\r\n",
      "hopes long past.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just the same,\" said Miss Patty at last, \"there are worse things in the\r\n",
      "world than being old-fashioned.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In which I think you would have agreed with her, if you could have seen\r\n",
      "Mary that same evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the time of which I am now writing she was six years old--a rather\r\n",
      "quiet, solemn child--though she had a smile upon occasions, which was\r\n",
      "well worth going to see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For some time back she had heard her aunts speaking of \"Poor Josiah!\" She\r\n",
      "had always stood in awe of her father who seemed taller and gaunter than\r\n",
      "ever. Mary seldom saw him, but she knew that every night after dinner he\r\n",
      "went to his den and often stayed there (she had heard her aunts say)\r\n",
      "until long after midnight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If he only had some cheerful company,\" she once heard Aunt Cordelia\r\n",
      "remark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But that's the very thing he seems to shun since poor Martha died,\"\r\n",
      "sighed Miss Patty, and dropping her voice, never dreaming for a moment\r\n",
      "that Mary was listening, she added with another sigh, \"If there had only\r\n",
      "been a boy, too!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All these things Mary turned over in her mind, as few but children can,\r\n",
      "especially when they have dreamy eyes and often go a long time without\r\n",
      "saying anything. And on the same night when Aunt Patty had come to\r\n",
      "the conclusion that there are worse things in the world than being\r\n",
      "old-fashioned, Mary waited until she knew that dinner was over and then,\r\n",
      "escaping Ma'm Maynard, she stole downstairs, her heart skipping a beat\r\n",
      "now and then at the adventure before her. She passed through the hall and\r\n",
      "the library like a determined little ghost and then, gently turning the\r\n",
      "knob, she opened the study door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father was sitting at his desk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the sound of the opening door he turned and stared at the apparition\r\n",
      "which confronted him. Mary had closed the door and stood with her back to\r\n",
      "it, screwing up her courage for the last stage of her journey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in truth it must have taken courage, for there was something in old\r\n",
      "Josiah's forbidding brow and solitary mien which would have chilled the\r\n",
      "purpose of any child. It may have been this which suddenly brought the\r\n",
      "tears to Mary's eyes, or it may have been that her womanly little breast\r\n",
      "guessed the loneliness in her father's heart. Whatever it was, she\r\n",
      "unsteadily crossed the room, her sight blurred but her plan as steadfast\r\n",
      "as ever, and a moment later she was climbing on Josiah's knee, her arms\r\n",
      "tight around his neck, sobbing as though it would shake her little frame\r\n",
      "to pieces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What passed between those two, partly in speech but chiefly in silence\r\n",
      "with their wet cheeks pressed together, I need not tell you; but when\r\n",
      "Ma'm Maynard came searching for her charge and stood quite open-mouthed\r\n",
      "in the doorway, Josiah waved her away, his finger on his lip, and later\r\n",
      "he carried Mary upstairs himself--and went back to his study without a\r\n",
      "word, though blowing his nose in a key which wasn't without significance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And nearly every night after that, when dinner was over, Mary made a\r\n",
      "visit to old Josiah's study downstairs; and one Saturday morning when he\r\n",
      "was leaving for the factory, he heard the front door open and shut behind\r\n",
      "him and there stood Mary, her little straw bonnet held under her chin\r\n",
      "with an elastic. In the most matter of fact way she slipped her fingers\r\n",
      "into his hand. He hesitated, but woman-like she pulled him on. The next\r\n",
      "minute they were walking down the drive together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they passed the end of the house, he remembered the words which he had\r\n",
      "once used to his sisters, \"After seven generations you simply can't keep\r\n",
      "them away. It's bred in the bone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A thrill ran over him as he looked at the little figure by his side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If she had only been a boy!\" he breathed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the end of the drive he stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must go back now, dear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said Mary and tried to pull him on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For as long as it might take you to count five, Josiah stood there\r\n",
      "irresolute, Mary's fingers pulling him one way and the memory of poor\r\n",
      "Martha's fate pulling him the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet,\" he thought, \"she's bound to see it sometime. Perhaps better\r\n",
      "now--before she understands--than later--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lifted her and sat her on his arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, listen, little woman,\" he said as they gravely regarded each other.\r\n",
      "\"This is important. If I take you this morning, will you promise to be a\r\n",
      "good girl, and sit in the office, and not go wandering off by yourself?\r\n",
      "Will you promise me that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This, too, may have been heredity, going back as far as Eve: Still\r\n",
      "gravely regarding him she nodded her head in silence and promised him\r\n",
      "with a kiss. He set her down, her hand automatically slipping into his\r\n",
      "palm again, and together they walked to the factory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The road made a sharp descent to the interval by the side of the river,\r\n",
      "almost affording a bird's-eye view of the buildings below--lines of\r\n",
      "workshops of an incredible length, their ventilators like the helmets of\r\n",
      "an army of giants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A freight train was disappearing into one of the warehouses. Long lines\r\n",
      "of trucks stood on the sidings outside. Wisps of steam arose in every\r\n",
      "direction, curious, palpitating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From up the river the roar of the falls could just be heard while from\r\n",
      "the open windows of the factory came that humming note of industry which,\r\n",
      "more than anything else, is like the sound which is sometimes made by a\r\n",
      "hive of bees, immediately before a swarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a scene which always gave Josiah a well-nigh oppressive feeling\r\n",
      "of pride and punishment--pride that all this was his, that he was\r\n",
      "one of those Spencers who had risen so high above the common run of\r\n",
      "man--punishment that he had betrayed the trust which had been handed down\r\n",
      "to him, that he had broken the long line of fathers and sons which had\r\n",
      "sent the Spencer reputation, with steadily increasing fame, to the\r\n",
      "corners of the earth. As he walked down the hall that Saturday morning,\r\n",
      "his sombre eyes missing no detail, he felt Mary's fingers tighten around\r\n",
      "his hand and, glancing down at her, he saw that her attention, too, was\r\n",
      "engrossed by the scene below, her eyes large and bright as children's are\r\n",
      "when they listen to a fairy tale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Arrived at the office, he placed her in a chair by the side of his desk,\r\n",
      "and you can guess whether she missed anything of what went on. Clerks,\r\n",
      "business callers, heads of departments came and went. All had a smile for\r\n",
      "Mary who gravely smiled in return and straightway became her dignified\r\n",
      "little self again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When is Mr. Woodward expected back?\" Josiah asked a clerk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the ten-thirty, from Boston.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was Stanley Woodward, Josiah's cousin--Cousin Stanley of the\r\n",
      "spider's web whom you have already met. He was now the general manager of\r\n",
      "the factory, and had always thought that fate was on his side since the\r\n",
      "night he had heard of Martha's death and that the child she left behind\r\n",
      "her was a girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Josiah glanced at his watch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Time to make the rounds,\" he said and, lifting Mary on his arm, he left\r\n",
      "the office and started through the plant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, oh, how Mary loved it--the forests of belts, whirring and twisting\r\n",
      "like live things, the orderly lines of machine tools, each doing its work\r\n",
      "with more than human ingenuity and precision, the enormous presses\r\n",
      "reminding her of elephants stamping out pieces of metal, the grinders\r\n",
      "which sang to her, the drilling machines which whirred to her, the\r\n",
      "polishing machines which danced for her, the power hammers which bowed to\r\n",
      "her. Yes, and better than all was the smile that each man gave her,\r\n",
      "smiles that came from the heart, for all the quiet respect that\r\n",
      "accompanied them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's his daughter,\" they whispered as soon as Josiah was out of hearing.\r\n",
      "Here and there one would stop smiling and say, \"I remember the day he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At the end of one of the workshops, Mr. Spencer looked at his watch\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We'd better get back to the office,\" he said. \"Tired, dear?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a rapture of denial, she kicked her little toes against his side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bred in the bone...\" he mused. \"Eh, if she had only been a boy...!\" But\r\n",
      "that was past all sighing for, and in the distance he saw Cousin Stanley,\r\n",
      "just back from Boston, evidently coming to find him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary, too, was watching the approaching figure. She had sometimes seen\r\n",
      "him at the house and had formed against him one of those instinctive\r\n",
      "dislikes which few but children know. As Stanley drew near she turned her\r\n",
      "head and buried her face against her father's shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good news?\" asked Josiah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good news, of course,\" said Stanley, speaking as an irresistible force\r\n",
      "might speak, if it were endowed with a tongue. \"When Spencer & Son start\r\n",
      "out for a thing, they get it.\" You could tell that what he meant was\r\n",
      "\"When Stanley Woodward starts out for a thing, he gets it.\" His elbows\r\n",
      "suddenly grew restless. \"It will take a lot of money,\" he added. \"Of\r\n",
      "course we shall have to increase the factory here--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still Mary kept her face hidden against her father's shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Got the little lady with you, I see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; I'm afraid I've tired her out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A murmur arose from his shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What?\" said Josiah. \"Not tired? Then turn around and shake hands with\r\n",
      "Uncle Stanley.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Slowly, reluctantly, Mary lifted her head and began to reach out her\r\n",
      "hand. Then just before their fingers would have touched, she quickly\r\n",
      "clasped her hands around her father's neck and again she buried her face\r\n",
      "upon his shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She doesn't seem to take to you,\" said Josiah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So it seems,\" said the other dryly. Reaching around he touched Mary's\r\n",
      "cheek with the back of his finger. \"Not mad at your uncle, are you,\r\n",
      "little girl?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't!\" said Josiah, speaking with quick concern. \"You're only making\r\n",
      "her tremble....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two stared at each other, slightly frowning. Stanley was the first to\r\n",
      "catch himself. \"I'll see you at the office later,\" he said, and with a\r\n",
      "bow at the little figure on Josiah's arm he added with a touch of irony,\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps I had better wait until you're alone!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned and made his way back to the office, his elbows grown restless\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A good thing it isn't a boy,\" he thought, \"or he might not like me when\r\n",
      "he grows up, either. But a girl... Oh, well, as it happens, girls don't\r\n",
      "count.... And a good thing, too, they don't,\" he thoughtfully added. \"A\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She never outgrew her aversion to Uncle Stanley, though.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day, when she was in Josiah's office, a young man entered and was\r\n",
      "warmly greeted by her father. He carried a walking stick, sported a white\r\n",
      "edging on his waistcoat and had just the least suspicion of perfumery on\r\n",

      "watched him with an interest that had something of fascination in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before she was ten, she and Josiah had become old chums. She knew the\r\n",
      "factory by the river almost as well as she knew the house on the hill.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "That year an addition was being made to the factory and Mary liked to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said Mary, shaking her head, \"I'm sure it isn't that way. You're\r\n",

      "Meanwhile the matter of Mary's education was receiving the attention of\r\n",
      "her aunts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Patty,\" said Miss Cordelia one day, \"do you know that child of ours is\r\n",
      "seventeen?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The years had dealt kindly with the Misses Spencer and as they looked at\r\n",
      "each other, with thoughtful benignity, their faces were like two studies\r\n",
      "in silver and pink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Although I say it myself,\" continued Miss Cordelia, \"I doubt if we could\r\n",
      "have improved her studies. Indeed she is unusually advanced in French,\r\n",
      "English and music. But I do think she ought to go to a good finishing\r\n",
      "school now for a year or two--Miss Parsons', of course--where she would\r\n",
      "not only be welcomed because of her family, but where she would form\r\n",
      "suitable friendships and learn those lessons of modern deportment which\r\n",
      "we ourselves, I fear, would never be able to teach her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But if you had been there when the subject of Miss Parsons' School for\r\n",
      "Young Ladies was broached to Mary, I think it would have reminded you of\r\n",
      "that famous recipe for rabbit pie which so wisely begins \"First catch\r\n",
      "your rabbit.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary listened to all that was said and then, quietly but unmistakably,\r\n",
      "she put her foot down on Miss Parsons' fashionable institution of\r\n",
      "learning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I doubt if she herself could have given you all her reasons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For one thing, the older she grew, the more democratic, the more American\r\n",
      "she was becoming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Deep in her heart she thought the old original Spencers had done more for\r\n",
      "the world than any leaders of fashion who ever lived; and when she read\r\n",
      "or thought of those who had made America, her mind never went to smart\r\n",
      "society and its doings, but to those great, simple souls who had braved\r\n",
      "the wilderness in search of liberty and adventure--who had toiled, and\r\n",
      "fought, and given their lives, unknown, unsung, but never in Mary's mind\r\n",
      "to be forgotten. And whenever she thought of travel, she found she would\r\n",
      "rather see the Rockies than the Alps, rather go to New Orleans than Old\r\n",
      "Orleans, rather visit the Grand Canyon than the Nile, and would\r\n",
      "infinitely rather cross the American continent and see three thousand\r\n",
      "miles of her own country, than cross the Atlantic and see three thousand\r\n",
      "miles of water that belonged to every one in general and no one in\r\n",
      "particular.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, my dear,\" said Miss Cordelia, altogether taken aback, \"you ought to\r\n",

      "\"It's no use, Aunty. I don't want to go to Miss Parsons' school--\"\r\n",

      "gasped. If Mary had been noticing, she might not have pursued her\r\n",
      "inspiration further, but her mind was running along a breathless panorama\r\n",
      "of Niagara Falls, Great Lakes, Chicago, the farms of the Middle West,\r\n",
      "Yellowstone Park, geysers, the Old Man of the Mountain, Aztec ruins,\r\n",
      "redwood forests, orange groves and at the end of the vista--like a statue\r\n",
      "at the end of a garden walk--she imagined a great democratic institution\r\n",
      "of learning where one might conceivably be prepared to solve some of\r\n",
      "those problems which life seems to take such deep delight in presenting\r\n",
      "to us, with the grim command, \"Not one step farther shall you go until\r\n",
      "you have answered this!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To college?\" gasped Miss Cordelia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mary, still intent upon her panorama, \"there's a good one in\r\n",
      "California. I'll look it up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The more Mary thought of it, the fonder she grew of her idea--which is, I\r\n",
      "think, a human trait and true of nearly every one. It was in vain that\r\n",
      "her aunts argued with her, pointing out the social advantages which she\r\n",
      "would enjoy from attending Miss Parsons' School. Mary's objection was\r\n",
      "fundamental. She simply didn't care for those advantages. Indeed, she\r\n",
      "didn't regard them as advantages at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Helen did, though.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In her heart Helen had always longed to tread the stage of society--to\r\n",
      "her mind, a fairyland of wit and gallantry, masquerades and music, to say\r\n",
      "nothing of handsome young polo players and titled admirers from foreign\r\n",
      "shores--\"big fools,\" all of them, as you can guess, when dazzled by the\r\n",
      "smiles of Youth and Beauty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mary can go to California if she likes,\" said Helen at last, \"but give\r\n",
      "me Miss Parsons' School.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Mary did go to California, although I doubt if she would have gained\r\n",
      "her point if her father hadn't taken her part. For four years she\r\n",
      "attended the university by the Golden Gate, and every time she made the\r\n",
      "journey between the two oceans, sometimes accompanied by Miss Cordelia\r\n",
      "and sometimes by Miss Patty, she seemed to be a little more serene of\r\n",
      "glance, a little more tranquil of brow, as though one by one she were\r\n",
      "solving some of those problems which I have mentioned above.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Helen was in her glory at Miss Parsons'; and though the two\r\n",
      "aunts didn't confess it, they liked to sit and listen to her chatter of\r\n",
      "the girls whose friendship she was making, and to whose houses she was\r\n",
      "invited for the holidays.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When she was home, she sang snatches from the operas, danced with\r\n",
      "imaginary partners, rehearsed parts of private theatricals and dreamed of\r\n",
      "conquests. She had also learned the knack of dressing her hair which,\r\n",
      "when done in the grand manner, isn't far from being a talent. Pulled down\r\n",
      "on one side, with a pin or two adjusted, she was a dashing young duchess\r\n",
      "who rode to hounds and made the old duke's eyes pop out. Or she could dip\r\n",
      "it over her ears, change a few pins again and--lo!--she was St. Cecilia\r\n",
      "seated at the organ, and butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She is quite pretty and very clever,\" said Miss Cordelia one day. \"I\r\n",
      "think she will marry well.\"\r\n",

      "\"Do you think she's as pretty as Mary?\" asked Miss Patty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear!\" said Miss Cordelia with a look that said 'What a question you\r\n",
      "are asking!' \"--is pretty in a way, of course,\" she said, \"but there is\r\n",
      "something about our Mary--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know,\" nodded Miss Patty. \"Something you can't express--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The dear child,\" mused Miss Cordelia, looking out toward the west. \"I\r\n",
      "wonder what she is doing this very moment!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that very moment, as it happened, Mary was in her room on the other\r\n",
      "side of the continent studying the manufacture of raisin fudge.\r\n",
      "Theretofore she had made it too soft, or too sugary, but this time she\r\n",
      "was determined to have it right. Long ago she had made all the friends\r\n",
      "that her room would hold, and most of them were there. Some were\r\n",
      "listening to a girl in spectacles who was talking socialism, while a more\r\n",
      "frivolous group, perched on the bed, was arguing the question whether the\r\n",
      "perfect lover had a moustache or a clean-shaven lip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Money is cruel; it ought to be abolished,\" said the earnest girl in the\r\n",
      "spectacles. \"Money is a millstone which the rich use to grind the poor.\r\n",
      "You girls know it as well as I do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary stirred away at the fudge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a good thing she doesn't know that I'm rich,\" she smiled to\r\n",
      "herself. \"I wonder when I shall start grinding the poor!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet the world simply couldn't get along without the wage-earners,\"\r\n",
      "continued the young orator. \"So all they have to do is strike--and\r\n",
      "strike--and keep on striking--and they can have everything they want--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So could the doctors,\" mused Mary to herself, stirring away at the\r\n",
      "fudge. \"Imagine the doctors striking.... And so could the farmers.\r\n",
      "Imagine the farmers striking for eight hours a day, and no work Sundays\r\n",
      "and holidays, and every Saturday afternoon off....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dimly, vaguely, a troubled picture took shape in her mind. She stirred\r\n",
      "the fudge more reflectively than ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wonder if civil wars are started that way,\" she thought, \"one class\r\n",
      "setting out to show its power over another and gradually coming to blows.\r\n",
      "Suppose--yes, suppose the women were to go on strike for eight hours a\r\n",
      "day, and as much money as the men, and Saturday afternoons and Sundays\r\n",
      "off, and all the rest of it.... The world certainly couldn't get along\r\n",
      "without women. As Becky says, they would only have to strike--and\r\n",
      "strike--and keep on striking--and they could get everything they\r\n",
      "wanted--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although she didn't suspect it, she was so close to her destiny at that\r\n",
      "moment that she could have reached out her hand and touched it. But all\r\n",
      "unconsciously she continued to stir the fudge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've always thought that women have a poor time of it compared with\r\n",
      "men,\" she nodded to herself. \"Still, perhaps it's the way of the world,\r\n",
      "like ... like children have the measles ... and old folks have to wear\r\n",
      "glasses.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She put the pan on the sill to cool and stood there for a time, looking\r\n",
      "out at the campus, dreamy-eyed, half occupied with her own thoughts and\r\n",
      "half listening to the conversation behind her.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Indeed it was her secret ambition to outshine her cousin--an ambition\r\n",

      "For the first few months after her father's death, Mary's dreams seemed\r\n",
      "to fade into mist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Between her and Josiah a bond of love had existed, stronger than either\r\n",
      "had suspected--and now that he was gone the world seemed unaccountably\r\n",
      "empty--and unaccountably cruel. As her father had gone, so must Aunt\r\n",
      "Cordelia and Aunt Patty some day surely go ... Yes, and even Mary herself\r\n",
      "must just as surely follow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The immemorial doubt assailed her--that doubt which begins in\r\n",
      "helplessness and ends in despair. \"What's the use?\" she asked herself.\r\n",
      "\"We plan and work so hard--like children making things in the sand--and\r\n",
      "then Death comes along with a big wave and flattens everything out ...\r\n",
      "like that ...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But gradually her sense of balance began to return. One day she stood on\r\n",
      "the brink of the hill looking at the great factory below, and a calmer,\r\n",
      "surer feeling slowly swept over her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it,\" she thought. \"The real things of life go on, no matter who\r\n",
      "dies, just as though nothing had happened. Take the first Josiah Spencer\r\n",
      "and look down there what he left behind him. Why, you might even say that\r\n",
      "he was alive today! And see what Washington left behind him--and Fulton,\r\n",
      "who invented the steamboat--and Morse who invented the telegraph. So it's\r\n",
      "silly to say 'What's the use?' Suppose Columbus had said it--or any of\r\n",
      "the others who have done great things in the world--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It slowly came to her then, her doubts still lingering, how many are\r\n",
      "called, how few are chosen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's the trouble,\" she said. \"We can't all be Washingtons. We can't\r\n",
      "all do great things. And yet--an awful lot of people had to live so that\r\n",
      "Washington could be born when he was....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His parents: that was two. And his grand-parents: he must have had four.\r\n",
      "And his great grand-parents: eight of them....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, it's like the problem of the horse-shoe nails,\" she continued in\r\n",
      "growing excitement. \"In twenty-eight generations there must have been\r\n",
      "millions and millions of people who lived--just so George Washington\r\n",
      "could be born one day at Mt. Vernon--and grow up to make America free!\r\n",
      "Yes, and every one of them was just as necessary as Washington himself,\r\n",
      "because if it hadn't been for every single one of them--we would never\r\n",
      "have had him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment she seemed to be in touch with the infinite plan. Down the\r\n",
      "hill she saw a woman in a black dress, crossing the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Ridge going out for the day,\" thought Mary, recognizing the figure\r\n",
      "below. \"Yes, and who knows? She may be a link in a chain which is leading\r\n",
      "straight down to some one who will be greater than Washington--greater\r\n",
      "than Shakespeare--greater than any man who ever lived...!\" And her old\r\n",
      "dreams, her old visions beginning to return, she added with a sigh, \"Oh,\r\n",
      "dear! I wish I could do something big and noble--so if all those millions\r\n",
      "who are back of me are watching, they'll feel proud of what I'm doing and\r\n",

      "told--as I believe great thoughts often do--but at least I think you'll\r\n",
      "be able to grasp the idea which she herself was groping after. At the\r\n",
      "same time you mustn't suppose that she was constantly going around\r\n",
      "dreaming, and trying to find expression for those vague strivings and\r\n",
      "yearnings which come to us all at different times in our lives,\r\n",
      "especially in the golden days of youth when the flood of ambition is\r\n",
      "rising high within us--or again in later years when we feel the tide will\r\n",
      "soon begin to turn, and we must make haste or it will be too late.\r\n",

      "No, Mary had plenty of practical matters, too, to engage her attention\r\n",

      "For one thing there was Wally Cabot--he who had so lately serenaded Mary\r\n",
      "in the moonlight. But I'll tell you about him later.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the settlement of her father's estate kept coming up for action.\r\n",
      "Judge Cutler and Mary's two aunts were the trustees--an arrangement which\r\n",
      "didn't please Uncle Stanley any too well, although he was careful not to\r\n",
      "show it. And the more Mary saw of the silvery haired judge with his\r\n",
      "hawk's eyes and gentle smile, the more she liked him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the first things they discovered was that Mary's heritage\r\n",
      "consisted of the factory by the river--but little else. Practically all\r\n",
      "the bonds and investments that Josiah had ever owned had been sold for\r\n",
      "the greater glory of Spencer & Son--to buy in other firms and patents--to\r\n",
      "increase the factory by the river. As her father had once confided to\r\n",
      "Mary this had taken money--\"a dreadful lot of money\"--she remembered the\r\n",
      "wince with which he had spoken--and a safe deposit box which was nearly\r\n",
      "empty bore evidence to the truth of what he had said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"High and low,\" mused the judge when the inventory was at last completed,\r\n",
      "\"it's always the same. The millionaire and the mill-hand--somehow they\r\n",
      "always manage to leave less than every one expected--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why is that?\" asked Mary. \"Is it because the heirs expect too much?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, child. I think it's the result of pride. As a rule, man is a proud\r\n",
      "animal and he doesn't like to tell anything which doesn't redound to his\r\n",
      "credit. If a man buys bonds, for instance, he is very apt to mention it\r\n",
      "to his family. But if for any reason he has to sell those bonds, he will\r\n",
      "nearly always do it quietly and say nothing about it, hoping to buy them\r\n",
      "back again later, or something better yet--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've seen so many estates,\" he continued, \"shrink into next to\r\n",
      "nothing--so many widows who thought they were well off, suddenly waking\r\n",
      "up and finding themselves at the mercy of the world--the little they have\r\n",
      "often being taken away from them by the first glib sharper who comes\r\n",
      "long--that I sometimes think every man should give his family a show-down\r\n",
      "once a year. It would surely save a lot of worries and heartaches later\r\n",
      "on--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Still,\" he smiled, looking down at the inventory, with its noble line of\r\n",
      "figures at the bottom of the column, \"I don't think you'll have much\r\n",
      "trouble in keeping the wolf from the door.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary turned the pages in a helpless sort of way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll have to explain some of this,\" she said at last. But before\r\n",
      "giving it back to him she looked out of the window for a time--one of her\r\n",
      "slow, thoughtful glances--and added, \"I wonder why girls aren't brought\r\n",
      "up to know something about business--the way boys are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps it's because they have no head for business.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought that over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can you speak French?\" she suddenly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"...I can. I can speak it, and read it, and write it, and think it....\r\n",
      "Now don't you think that if a girl can do that--if she can learn\r\n",
      "thousands and thousands of new words, how to pronounce them, and spell\r\n",
      "them, and parse them, and inflect them--how to supply hundreds of rules\r\n",
      "of grammar--and if she can learn to do this so well that she can chat\r\n",
      "away in French without giving it a thought--don't you think she might be\r\n",
      "able to learn something about the language and rules of business, too, if\r\n",
      "they were only taught to her? Then perhaps there wouldn't be so many\r\n",
      "helpless widows in the world, as you said just now, at the mercy of the\r\n",
      "first glib sharper who comes along.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time it was the judge's turn to think it over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're an exceptional girl, Mary,\" he said at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, really I'm not,\" she earnestly told him. \"Any girl can learn\r\n",
      "anything that a boy can learn--if she is only given a chance. Where\r\n",
      "boys and girls go to school together--at the grammar schools and high\r\n",
      "schools--the girls are just as quick as the boys, and their average marks\r\n",
      "are quite as high. It was true at college, too. The girls could learn\r\n",
      "anything that the men could learn--and do it just as well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As one result of this, Judge Cutler began giving Mary lessons in\r\n",
      "business, using the inventory as a text and explaining each item in the\r\n",
      "settlement of the estate. He also taught her some of the simpler maxims,\r\n",
      "beginning with that grand old caution, \"Never sign a paper for a\r\n",
      "stranger--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It wasn't long after this that Uncle Stanley called at the house on the\r\n",
      "hill. He talked for a time about some of the improvements which were\r\n",
      "being made at the factory and then arose as if to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I nearly forgot,\" he said, turning back and smiling at his\r\n",
      "oversight. \"We need a new director to take your father's place. When I'm\r\n",
      "away Burdon looks after things, so I suppose he may as well take the\r\n",
      "responsibility. It's a thankless position, but some one has to fill it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" murmured Mary, \"I suppose they do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They do,\" said Uncle Stanley. \"So I'll call a stockholders' meeting\r\n",
      "right away. Meanwhile if you will sign this proxy--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But just as quietly Mary murmured, \"I'd like to think it over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They looked at each other then--those two--with that careful, yet\r\n",
      "careless-appearing glance which two duellists might employ when some\r\n",
      "common instinct warns them that sooner or later they will cross their\r\n",
      "swords.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Uncle Stanley was the first to lower his eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The law requires three directors,\" he said in his more usual grumpy\r\n",
      "voice, \"or I wouldn't have bothered you. I'll leave it and you can sign\r\n",
      "it and send it down this afternoon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary did neither. Instead she went to see Judge Cutler and when\r\n",
      "the stockholders' meeting was finally called, she attended it in\r\n",
      "person--holding practically all the stock--and Judge Cutler was elected\r\n",
      "to fill the vacancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Uncle Stanley just managed to control himself. It took an effort, but he\r\n",
      "did it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We've got to elect a president next,\" he said, trying to make a joke of\r\n",
      "it, but unable to keep the tremor of testiness out of his voice. \"Of\r\n",
      "course I've been here all my life--if that counts for anything--and I am\r\n",
      "now serving in the more or less humble capacity of vice-president--but if\r\n",
      "the judge would like to throw up his law business and try the\r\n",
      "manufacturing end instead--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" smiled the judge, lighting a bombshell--though Uncle Stanley little\r\n",
      "guessed it--\"I think the position calls for some one younger than I am.\r\n",
      "Besides, my name is Cutler, whereas for eight generations this concern\r\n",
      "has been headed by a Spencer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You know, Mr. Woodward, lawyers are sticklers for precedent, and it\r\n",

      "his heels!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course, if you want to make a joke of the company,\" he said at last,\r\n",
      "sticking out his lower lip till it made a little shelf, although it\r\n",
      "wasn't a very steady little shelf because it trembled as though from\r\n",
      "emotion. \"'President, Mary Spencer'--you know as well as I do what people\r\n",

      "around that difficulty. We can have the letter-heads lithographed\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As in the case of the factory, Uncle Stanley had also been vice-president\r\n",

      "recorded, the stockholders of the bank met to choose a new president.\r\n",

      "diamond rings. The story was made remarkable by a detail. An old woman\r\n",
      "was sitting at the corner, grinding a hand-organ, and as the robber ran\r\n",
      "past her, he dropped one of the rings into her cup.\r\n",

      "\"If they can do it, we can do it, too--don't you think so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "America is the grandest of them all, or they wouldn't keep coming here as\r\n",

      "you have probably often noticed, suspicion feeds upon suspicion, and as\r\n",
      "Mary walked through the outer office she felt that more than one pair of\r\n",

      "Archey Forbes came back in the beginning of May and the first call he\r\n",
      "made was to the house on the hill. He had brought with him a collection\r\n",
      "of souvenirs--a trench-made ring, shrapnel fragments of curious shapes,\r\n",
      "the inevitable helmet and a sword handle with a piece of wire attached.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was part of our work once,\" he said, \"to find booby traps and make\r\n",
      "them harmless. This was in a barn, looking as though some one had tried\r\n",
      "to hide his sword in the hay. It looked funny to me, so I went at it easy\r\n",
      "and found the wire connected to a fuse. There was enough explosive to\r\n",
      "blow up the barn and everybody around there, but it wouldn't blow up a\r\n",
      "hill of bears when we got through with it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He coloured a little through his bronze. \"I thought you might like these\r\n",
      "things,\" he awkwardly continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like them? I'd love them!\" said Mary, her eyes sparkling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I brought them for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were both silent for a time, looking at the souvenirs, but presently\r\n",
      "their glances met and they smiled at each other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course you're going back to the factory,\" she said; and when he\r\n",
      "hesitated she continued, \"I shall rely on you to let me know how things\r\n",
      "are going on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again he coloured a little beneath his bronze and Mary found herself\r\n",
      "watching it with an indefinable feeling of satisfaction. And after he was\r\n",
      "gone and she was carrying the souvenirs to the den, she also found\r\n",
      "herself singing a few broken bars from the Blue Danube.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that you singing!\" shouted Helen from the library.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Trying to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Helen came hurrying as though to see a miracle, for Mary couldn't sing.\r\n",
      "\"Oh--oh!\" she said, her eyes falling on the helmet. \"Who sent it? Wally\r\n",
      "Cabot?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; Archey Forbes brought it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh-ho!\" said Helen again. \"Now I see-ee-ee!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But if she did, she saw more than Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps she thinks I'm in love with him,\" she thought, and though the\r\n",
      "reflection brought a pleasant sense of disturbance with it, it wasn't\r\n",
      "long before she was shaking her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know what it is,\" she decided at last, \"but I'm sure I'm not in\r\n",
      "love with him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As nearly as I can express it, Mary was in love with love, and could no\r\n",
      "more help it than she could help the crease in her chin or the dreaminess\r\n",
      "of her eyes. If Archey had had the field to himself, her heart might soon\r\n",
      "have turned to him as unconsciously and innocently as a flower turns its\r\n",
      "petals to the sun. But the day after Archey returned, Wally Cabot came\r\n",
      "back and he, too, laid his souvenirs at Mary's feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the same Wally as ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had also brought a piece of old lace for Aunt Cordelia, a jet necklace\r\n",
      "for Aunt Patty, a prison-camp brooch for Helen. All afternoon he held\r\n",
      "them with tales of his adventures in the air, rolling up his sleeve to\r\n",
      "show them a scar on his arm, and bending his head down so they could see\r\n",
      "where a German ace had nicked a bit of his hair out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "More than once Mary felt her breath come faster, and when Aunt Cordelia\r\n",
      "invited him to stay to dinner and he chanced to look at her, she gave a\r\n",
      "barely perceptible signal \"Yes,\" and smiled to herself at the warmth of\r\n",
      "his acceptance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll telephone mother,\" he said, briskly rising. \"Where's the phone,\r\n",
      "Mary? I forget the way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She arose to show him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let's waltz out,\" he laughed. \"Play something, Helen. Something lively\r\n",
      "and happy....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a long time before Mary went to sleep that night. The moon was\r\n",
      "nearly full and shone in her windows, a stream of its rays falling on her\r\n",
      "bed and bringing to her those immortal waves of fancy which begin where\r\n",
      "the scent of flowers stop, and end where immortal and melancholy music\r\n",
      "begins. Unbidden tears came to her eyes, though she couldn't have told\r\n",
      "you why, and again a sense of the fleeting of time disturbed her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aunt Mary ...\" In a few years she would be old, and her hair would be\r\n",
      "white like Aunt Patty's.... And in a few years more....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But even as Wally Cabot kept her from thinking too much of Archey Forbes,\r\n",
      "so now Archey unconsciously revenged himself and kept her thoughts from\r\n",
      "centring too closely around Wally Cabot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Archey called the next afternoon and Mary sat on the veranda steps with\r\n",
      "him, while Helen made hay with Wally on a tete-a-tete above.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The few women who were left in the factory were having things made\r\n",
      "unpleasant for them: that was what Archey had come to tell her. Their\r\n",
      "canteen had been stopped; the day nursery discontinued; the nurses\r\n",
      "discharged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course they are not needed there any longer, so far as that is\r\n",
      "concerned,\" concluded Archey, \"but they certainly helped us out of a hole\r\n",
      "when we did need them, and it doesn't seem right now to treat them\r\n",
      "rough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At hearing this, a guilty feeling passed over Mary and left her cheeks\r\n",
      "warm. \"They'll think I've deserted them,\" she thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, haven't you?\" something inside her asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some of her old dreams returned to her mind, as though to mock her. She\r\n",
      "was going to be a new Moses once, leading her sisters out of the house of\r\n",
      "bondage. Woman was to have things different. Old drudgeries were to be\r\n",
      "lifted from her shoulders. The night was over. The dawn was at hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what can I do?\" she thought uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You can stop them from being treated roughly,\" something inside her\r\n",
      "answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can certainly do that,\" she nodded to herself. \"I'll telephone Uncle\r\n",
      "Stanley right away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Uncle Stanley was out, and Mary was going riding with Wally that\r\n",
      "afternoon. So she wrote a hurried note and left it at the factory as they\r\n",
      "passed by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear Uncle Stanley,\" it read,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Please see that every courtesy and attention is shown, the women who are\r\n",
      "still working. We may need them again some day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sincerely,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"MARY.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now!\" she said to Wally, and they started on their ride. And, oh, but\r\n",
      "that was a ride!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The afternoon was perfect, the sun warm but not hot, the air crystal\r\n",
      "clear. It had showered the night before and the world, in its spring\r\n",
      "dress, looked as though it had been washed and spruced for their\r\n",
      "approval.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All roses and lilies!\" laughed Wally. \"That's how I like life!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They went along hillsides and looked down into the beautiful valleys;\r\n",
      "they wound around by the sides of rivers and through deep woods; they\r\n",
      "went like the wind; they loafed; they explored country lanes and lost\r\n",
      "their way, stopped at a farm-house and found it again, shouted with\r\n",
      "delight when a squirrel tried to race them along the top of a fence,\r\n",
      "gasped together when they nearly ran over a turkey, chatted, laughed,\r\n",
      "sang (though this was a solo, for Mary couldn't sing, though she tried\r\n",
      "now and then under her breath), and with every mile they rode they seemed\r\n",
      "to pass invisible milestones along the road which leads from friendship\r\n",
      "to love.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It came to a crisis two weeks later, on an afternoon in June.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary was in the garden picking a bouquet for the table, and Wally went to\r\n",
      "help her. She gave him a smile that made his heart do a trick, and when\r\n",
      "he bent over to help her break a piece of mignonette, his hand touched\r\n",
      "hers....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mary....\" he whispered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you love me a little bit now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wonder....\" said she, and they both bent over to pick another piece of\r\n",
      "mignonette. Away down deep in Mary, a voice whispered, \"Somebody's\r\n",
      "watching.\" She looked toward the house and caught sight of Helen who was\r\n",
      "sitting sideways on the veranda rail and missing never a move.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wally followed Mary's glance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll be down here in a minute,\" he frowned to himself. At the bottom\r\n",
      "of the lawn, overlooking the valley, was a summer house of rustic cedar,\r\n",
      "nearly covered with honeysuckle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let's take a stroll down there, shall we?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tremor of his voice told Mary more than his words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He wants to love me,\" she thought, and burying her face in her bouquet\r\n",
      "she said in a muffled little voice, \"...I don't care.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They went down to the summer house, talking, trying to appear\r\n",
      "indifferent, but both of them knowing that a truly tremendous moment in\r\n",
      "their drama of life was close at hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They seated themselves opposite each other on the bench and Mary's dreamy\r\n",
      "eyes went out over the valley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mary....\" he began. She looked at him for a moment and then her glance\r\n",
      "went out over the valley again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you think we've waited long enough?\" he gently asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary's eyes were still upon the valley below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In a way, I'm glad you've waited,\" he said. \"Judge Cutler told me some\r\n",
      "of the wonderful things you did here during the war. But you don't want\r\n",
      "to be bothering with a factory as long as you live. It's grubby, narrow\r\n",
      "work, and there's so much else in life, so much that's beautiful and--and\r\n",
      "wonderful--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a fleeting moment a picture arose before Mary's eyes: a tired woman\r\n",
      "bending over a wash-tub with a crying child tugging at her skirt. \"So\r\n",
      "much that's beautiful--and wonderful\"--the words were still echoing\r\n",
      "around her, and almost without thinking she said a peculiar thing.\r\n",
      "\"Suppose we were poor,\" said she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But we aren't poor,\" smiled Wally. \"That's one reason why I want to take\r\n",
      "you away from this. What's the use of having things if you can't enjoy\r\n",
      "them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought that over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is so much that I have always wanted to see,\" he continued, \"but\r\n",
      "I've had sense enough to wait until I found the right girl--so we could\r\n",
      "go and see it together. Switzerland--and the Nile--and Japan--and the\r\n",
      "Riviera, with 'its skies for ever blue.' Any place we liked, we could\r\n",
      "stay till we were tired of it. And a house in New York--and an island in\r\n",
      "the St. Lawrence--or down near Palm Beach. There's nothing we couldn't\r\n",
      "do--nothing we couldn't have--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But don't you think--\" hesitated Mary and then stopped, timid of\r\n",
      "breaking the spell which was stealing over her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't I think what, dear?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know--but you see so many married people, who seem to have\r\n",
      "lost interest in each other--nice people, too. You see them at North East\r\n",

      "\"As I understand it,\" he replied, \"we are not here to argue the point.\r\n",
      "Same time, I don't see the harm of telling you what we think about it.\r\n",
      "First place, it isn't natural for a woman to be working in a factory.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, for one thing, if you don't mind me speaking out, because she has\r\n",
      "babies.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the war has proved a baby is lucky to have its mother working in a\r\n",
      "modern factory,\" replied Mary. \"The work is easier than housework, the\r\n",
      "surroundings are better, the matter is given more attention. As a result,\r\n",
      "the death rate of factory babies has been lower than the death rate of\r\n",

      "\"The women who have tried both. These four, for instance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, another thing,\" he said, \"a woman can't be looking after her\r\n",
      "children when she's working in a factory.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's true. But she can't be looking after them, either, when she's\r\n",
      "washing, or cooking, or doing things like that. They lie and cry--or\r\n",
      "crawl around and fall downstairs--or sit on the doorstep--or play in the\r\n",
      "street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, here, during the war,\" she continued, \"we had a day nursery. You\r\n",
      "never saw such happy children in your life. Why, almost the only time\r\n",
      "they cried was when they had to go home at night!\" Mary's eyes brightened\r\n",
      "at the memory of it. \"Didn't your son's wife have a baby in the nursery,\r\n",
      "Mr. Edsol?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Two,\" he solemnly nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For another thing,\" said the chairman, \"a woman is naturally weaker than\r\n",
      "a man. You couldn't imagine a woman standing up under overtime, for\r\n",
      "instance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, you shouldn't say that,\" said Mary earnestly, \"because everybody\r\n",

      "worked overtime.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here the third member of the committee muttered a gruff aside. \"No use\r\n",
      "talking to a woman,\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You be quiet, I'm doing this,\" said the chairman. \"Another thing that\r\n",
      "everybody knows,\" he continued to Mary, \"a woman hasn't the natural knack\r\n",
      "for mechanics that a man has.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"During the war,\" Mary told him, \"she mastered nearly two thousand\r\n",
      "different kinds of skilled work--work involving the utmost precision. And\r\n",
      "the women who did this weren't specially selected, either. They came from\r\n",
      "every walk of life--domestic servants, cooks, laundresses, girls who had\r\n",
      "never left home before, wives of small business men, daughters of dock\r\n",
      "labourers, titled ladies--all kinds, all conditions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She told him, then, some of the things women had made--read him\r\n",
      "reports--showed him pictures.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In fact,\" she concluded, \"we don't have to go outside this factory to\r\n",
      "prove that a woman has the same knack for mechanics that a man has.\r\n",
      "During the war we had as many women working here as men, and every one\r\n",
      "will tell you that they did as well as the men.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, let's look at it another way,\" said the chairman, and he nodded to\r\n",
      "his colleagues as though he knew there could be no answer to this one.\r\n",
      "\"There are only so many jobs to go around. What are the men going to do\r\n",

      "instrument board.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, one of the girls at the office. She's in my department--sort of a\r\n",
      "bookkeeper.\" Noticing Helen's silence he added more carelessly than\r\n",
      "before, \"You know how some girls act if you are any way pleasant to\r\n",
      "them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was one of those trifling incidents which occasionally seem to have\r\n",

      "warn her cousin, Helen had gone to the factory apparently to bring Mary\r\n",
      "home, but in reality to see Burdon. She had been in his private office,\r\n",
      "perched on the edge of his desk and swinging her foot, when the same girl\r\n",
      "came in--the girl who had smiled and stared near the station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right, Fanny,\" said Burdon without looking around. \"Leave the\r\n",
      "checks. I'll attend to them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seemed to Helen that the girl went out slowly, a sudden spot of colour\r\n",
      "on each of her cheeks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You call her Fanny!\" Helen asked, when, the door shut again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said, busy with the checks. \"They do more for you, when you are\r\n",

      "\"You think so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "signature on the next check. \"I often wish I was a sour, old crab,\" he\r\n",
      "said, half to Helen and half to himself. \"I'd get through life a whole\r\n",
      "lot better than I do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary had come to the door then, ready to start for home. When Helen\r\n",
      "passed through the outer office she saw the girl again, her cheek on her\r\n",
      "palm, her head bent over her desk, dipping her pen in the red ink and\r\n",
      "then pushing the point through her blotter pad. None of this was lost on\r\n",

      "stretched across the blotter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll go in now to get those checks,\" thought Helen, as the car started\r\n",
      "up the hill, and it was just then that Mary started to warn her about\r\n",
      "going out so much with Burdon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The next morning Mary was going through her mail at the office when she\r\n",

      "much attention.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clipping had been pasted upon a sheet of paper, and underneath it,\r\n",
      "the following two questions were typewritten:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can a man buy $8,000 cars on a $10,000 salary?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why don't you audit his books and see who paid for that car?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary's cheeks stung with the brutality of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What a horrible thing to do!\" she thought. \"If any one paid attention to\r\n",
      "things like this--why, no one would be safe!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was on the point of tearing it to shreds when another thought struck\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps I ought to show it to him,\" she uneasily thought. \"If a thing\r\n",
      "like this is being whispered around, I think he ought to get to the\r\n",
      "bottom of it, and stop it.... I know I don't like him for some things,\"\r\n",
      "she continued, more undecided than ever, \"but that's all the more reason\r\n",
      "why I should be fair to him--in things like this, for instance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She compromised by tucking the letter in her pocket, and when Judge\r\n",
      "Cutler dropped in that afternoon, she first made him promise secrecy, and\r\n",
      "then she showed it to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I feel like you,\" he said at last. \"An anonymous attack like this is\r\n",
      "usually beneath contempt. And I feel all the more like ignoring it\r\n",
      "because it raises a question which I have been asking myself lately: How\r\n",
      "_can_ a man on a ten thousand dollar salary afford to buy an eight\r\n",
      "thousand dollar car?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary couldn't follow that line of reasoning at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do you feel like ignoring it, if it's such a natural question?\" she\r\n",
      "asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because it's a question that might have occurred to anybody.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That puzzled Mary, too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps Burdon has money beside his salary,\" she suggested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He hasn't. I know he hasn't. He's in debt right now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They thought it over in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think if I were you, I'd tear it up,\" he said at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She promptly tore it into shreds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now we'll forget that,\" he said. \"I must confess, however, that it has\r\n",
      "raised another question to my mind. How long is it since your bookkeeping\r\n",
      "system was overhauled here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She couldn't remember.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just what I thought. It must need expert attention. Modern conditions\r\n",
      "call for modern methods, even in bookkeeping. I think I'll get a good\r\n",
      "firm of accountants to go over our present system, and make such changes\r\n",
      "as will keep you in closer touch with everything that is going on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary hardly knew what to think.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're sure it has nothing to do with this?\" she asked, indicating the\r\n",
      "fragments in the waste-basket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not the least connection! Besides,\" he argued, \"you and I know very\r\n",
      "well--don't we?--that with all his faults, Burdon would never do anything\r\n",
      "like that--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course he wouldn't!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well. I think we ought to forget that part of it, and never refer\r\n",
      "to it again--or it might be said that we were fearing for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This masculine logic took Mary's breath away, but though she thought it\r\n",
      "over many a time that day, she couldn't find the flaw in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Men are queer,\" she finally concluded. \"But then I suppose they think\r\n",
      "women are queer, too. To me,\" she thought, \"it almost seems insulting to\r\n",
      "Burdon to call accountants in now; but according to the judge it would be\r\n",
      "insulting to Burdon not to call them in--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was still puzzling over it when Archey, that stormy petrel of bad\r\n",
      "news, came in and very soon took her mind from anonymous letters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The finishers are getting ready to quit,\" he announced. \"They had a vote\r\n",
      "this noon. It was close, but the strikers won.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They both knew what a blow this would be. With each successive wave of\r\n",
      "the strike movement, it grew harder to fill the men's places with women.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If this keeps on, I don't know what we shall do,\" she thought. \"By the\r\n",
      "time we have filled these empty places, we shall have as many women\r\n",
      "working here as we had during the war.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Outwardly, however, she gave no signs of misgivings, but calmly set in\r\n",
      "motion the machinery which had filled the gaps before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you're going to put that advertisement in again,\" said Archey, \"I\r\n",
      "think I'd add 'Nursery, Restaurant, Rest-room, Music'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She included the words in her copy, and after a moment's reflection she\r\n",
      "added \"Laundry.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But we have no laundry,\" objected Archey, half laughing. \"Are you\r\n",
      "forgetting a little detail like that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I'm not,\" said Mary, her eyes dancing. \"You must do the same with\r\n",
      "the laundry as I did with the kindergarten. Go to Boston this\r\n",
      "afternoon.... Take a laundryman with you if you like.... And bring the\r\n",
      "things back in the morning by motor truck. We have steam and hot water\r\n",
      "and plenty of buildings, and I'm sure it won't take long to get the\r\n",
      "machines set up when you once get them here--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At such moments there was something great in Mary. To conceive a plan and\r\n",
      "put it through to an irresistible conclusion: there was nothing in which\r\n",
      "she took a deeper delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night, at home, she told them of her new plan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just think,\" she said, \"if a woman lives seventy years, and the washing\r\n",
      "is done once a week, you might say she spent one-seventh of her life--or\r\n",
      "ten whole years--at the meanest hardest work that was ever invented--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They don't do the washing when they're children,\" said Helen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "thousand women who never, never will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought that over, for this was an angle which hadn't occurred to her\r\n",
      "before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" she said, \"I'm not doing it to gain anything for myself, but to\r\n",

      "live for, something to make them happier than they are now. Yes, and from\r\n",
      "everybody's point of view, I think I'm doing something good. Because when\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"They must have had an accident,\" thought Mary, and at first she pictured\r\n",

      "local garage--perhaps the engine had overheated, or the battery had\r\n",
      "failed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when one o'clock struck, and still no word from the absent pair,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "By two o'clock she imagined the car overturned at the bottom of some\r\n",
      "embankment, and both of them badly hurt. At three o'clock she began to\r\n",
      "have such dire forebodings that she went and woke up Aunt Cordelia, and\r\n",
      "was on the point of telephoning Wally's mother when the welcome rumbling\r\n",
      "of a car was heard under the porte cochere. It was Wally and Helen, and\r\n",

      "apologetic escort which every woman understands.\r\n",

      "car out for us. But Helen, poor girl, was tired and of course I couldn't\r\n",
      "leave her there alone. So I tackled the engine again and just when I was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"They couldn't take us in--they were filled--but they promised to wake up\r\n",

      "smile at them both, for some reason which I can never hope to explain, it\r\n",
      "took an effort. Wally and Helen were still looking at each other.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Afterwards, when Mary looked back at the leading incidents of the big\r\n",
      "strike it wasn't the epic note which interested her the most, although\r\n",
      "the contest had for her its moments of exaltation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor did her thoughts revert the oftenest to those strange things which\r\n",
      "might have engrossed the chance observer--work and happiness walking hand\r\n",
      "in hand, for instance, to the accompaniment of Mrs. Kelly's drum--or\r\n",
      "woman showing that she can acquire the same dexterity on a drilling\r\n",

      "a cook stove, the same competence and neatness in a factory as in a\r\n",
      "house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Indeed, when all is said and done, the sound of the work which women were\r\n",
      "presently doing at New Bethel was only an echo of the tasks which women\r\n",
      "had done during four years of war, and being a repetition of history, it\r\n",
      "didn't surprise Mary when she stopped to think it over. But looking back\r\n",
      "at the whole experience later, these were the two reflections which\r\n",
      "interested her the most.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They have always called woman a riddle,\" she thought. \"I wonder if that\r\n",
      "is because she could never be natural. If woman has been a riddle in the\r\n",
      "past, I wonder if this is the answer now....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was her first reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her second was this, and in it she unconsciously worded one of the great\r\n",
      "lessons of life. \"The things I worried about seldom happened. It was\r\n",
      "something which nobody ever dreamed of--that nearly ended everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when she thought of that, her breath would come a little quicker and\r\n",
      "soon she would shake her head, and try to put her mind on something else;\r\n",
      "although if you had been there I think you would have seen a suspicious\r\n",
      "moisture in her eye, and if she were in her room at home, she would go to\r\n",
      "a photograph on the wall-the picture of a gravely smiling girl on a\r\n",
      "convent portico--signed \"With all my love, Rosa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, as you can see, I am running ahead of my story, and so that you\r\n",

      "them, I will now return to the morning when she received Archey's message\r\n",
      "that every man in the factory had gone on strike as a protest against the\r\n",
      "employment of women.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as she reached the office she sent a facsimile letter to the\r\n",
      "skilled women workers who had applied from out of town.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If we only get a third of them,\" she thought, \"we'll pull through\r\n",
      "somehow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary was reckoning without her book. For one thing, she was unaware\r\n",
      "of the publicity which her experiment was receiving, and for another\r\n",
      "thing perhaps it didn't occur to her that the same yearnings, the same\r\n",
      "longings, the same stirrings which moved her own heart and mind so\r\n",
      "often--the same vague feeling of imprisonment, the same vague groping for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Also a call was issued for local workers and the \"school\" was opened,\r\n",
      "larger than ever. For the first few weeks it might be said that half the\r\n",

      "Mary will never forget, a few lonely looking bearings made laborious\r\n",

      "which I will tell you about later.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The missing bridges weren't completed yet, you understand--not by any\r\n",

      "At the end of that day the reports showed that all the departments had\r\n",
      "made an improvement until the bearings reached the final assembling room\r\n",
      "and there the traffic had become congested. For the rest of the week the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And finally came the day when they _did_ make it! For four consecutive\r\n",
      "days their output equalled the best ever done by the factory, and then\r\n",
      "just as every woman was beginning to thrill with that jubilation which\r\n",
      "only comes of a hard task well done, a weak spot developed in the\r\n",
      "hardening department.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, how everybody frowned and clicked their tongues! You might have\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "One more good try, and they _did_ go over the top. For two days, three\r\n",

      "the first part of her vision had come true, she did a feminine thing,\r\n",
      "that is to say a human thing. She simultaneously said, \"I told you so,\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She had a gentle little cry all by herself, and then through her tears\r\n",

      "wrong and Helen's right; and I ought to have married Wally--and not one\r\n",
      "of you women ought to be here today!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A whisper arose in her mind. \"....Somebody's got to do the housework....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but it needn't take up a woman's whole life,\" she shortly told\r\n",
      "herself, \"any more than it does a man's. I'm sure there must be some\r\n",
      "way...some way....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stopped, a sudden flush striking along her cheek as she caught the\r\n",
      "first glimpse of her golden vision--that vision which may some day change\r\n",
      "the history of the human race. \"Oh, if I only could!\" she breathed to\r\n",
      "herself. \"If I only could!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She slowly returned to the office. Judge Cutler was waiting to see her,\r\n",
      "just back from his visit to Washington.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\" she asked eagerly, shutting the door. \"Are they going to boycott\r\n",
      "us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think so,\" he answered. \"I told them how it started. As far as I\r\n",
      "can find out, the strike here is a local affair. The men I saw disclaimed\r\n",
      "any knowledge or responsibility for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course, I pointed out that women had the vote now, and that boycotts\r\n",
      "were catching.... But I don't think you need worry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're splendid men--all of them. I'm sure you'd like them, Mary. They\r\n",
      "are all interested in what you are doing, but I think they are marking\r\n",
      "time a little--waiting to see how things turn out before they commit\r\n",
      "themselves one way or the other.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary thrilled at that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"More than ever now it depends on me,\" she thought, and another surge of\r\n",
      "greatness seemed to lift her like a flood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The judge's voice recalled her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On my way back,\" he was saying, \"I stopped in New York and engaged a\r\n",
      "firm of accountants to come and look over the books. They are busy now,\r\n",
      "but I told them there was no hurry--that we only wanted their\r\n",
      "suggestions--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I had forgotten about that,\" said Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So had I. What do you suppose reminded me of it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She shook her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One of the first men I saw in Washington was Burdon Woodward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think it just happened that way,\" said Mary uneasily. \"He told me he\r\n",
      "was going away for a few days, but I'm sure he only did it to get out of\r\n",
      "going to Helen's wedding.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, anyhow, no harm done. It was the sight of him down there that\r\n",
      "reminded me: that's all.... How has everything been running here?\r\n",
      "Smoothly, I hope?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Smoothly, yes. That was the week when Mary sent her letters to the\r\n",
      "papers, announcing that the women at Spencer & Son's had not only\r\n",
      "equalled past outputs, but were working within a closer degree of\r\n",
      "accuracy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And all that month, and the next month, and the next, the work at Spencer\r\n",
      "& Son's kept rolling out as smoothly as though it were moving on its own\r\n",
      "bearings--not only the mechanical, but the welfare work as well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dining room was re-modelled, as you will presently see. The band\r\n",
      "progressed, as you will presently hear. The women were proud and happy in\r\n",
      "the work they were doing, and Mary was proud because they were proud,\r\n",
      "happy because they were happy, and all the time she was nursing another\r\n",
      "secret, no one dreaming what was in her mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Along in the third month, Wally and Helen came back from their wedding\r\n",
      "tour. Mary looked once, and she saw there was something wrong with Wally.\r\n",
      "A shadow of depression hung over him--a shadow which he tried to hide\r\n",
      "with bursts of cheerfulness. But his old air of eagerness was gone--that\r\n",
      "air with which he had once looked at the future as a child might stare\r\n",
      "with delighted eyes at a conjurer drawing rabbits and roses out of old\r\n",
      "hats and empty vases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a word, he looked disenchanted, as though he had seen how the illusion\r\n",
      "was produced, how the trick was done, and was simultaneously abating his\r\n",
      "applause for the performer and his interest in the show.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's found her out,\" thought Mary, and with that terrible frankness\r\n",
      "which sometimes comes unbidden to our minds she added with a sigh, \"I was\r\n",
      "always afraid he would.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wally had taken a house near the country club--one of those brick\r\n",
      "mansions surrounded by trees and lawns which are somehow reminiscent of\r\n",
      "titled society and fox hunters in buckskin and scarlet. There Helen was\r\n",
      "soon working her way to the leadership of the younger set.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She seldom called at the house on the hill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm generally dated up for the evening, and you're never there in the\r\n",
      "daytime. So I have to drop in and see you here,\" she said one afternoon,\r\n",
      "giving Mary a surprise visit at the office. \"Do you, know you're getting\r\n",
      "to be fashionable?\" she continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who? Me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. You. Nearly everywhere we went, they began quizzing us as soon as\r\n",
      "they found Miss Spencer was a cousin of mine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary noted Helen's self-promotion to the head of the cousinship, but she\r\n",
      "kept her usual tranquil expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's because she's Mrs. Cabot now,\" she thought. \"Perhaps she wouldn't\r\n",
      "have called at all if these people hadn't mentioned me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when Helen arose to go, Mary revised her opinion of the reason for\r\n",
      "her cousin's call.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I must be going,\" said Helen, rising. \"I'll drop in and see Burdon\r\n",
      "for a few minutes on my way out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it,\" thought Mary, and her reflections again taking upon\r\n",
      "themselves that terrible frankness which can seldom be put in words, she\r\n",
      "added to herself, \"Poor Wally.... I was always afraid of it....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was still looking out of the window in troubled meditation when the\r\n",
      "arrival of the afternoon mail turned her thoughts into another track. As\r\n",
      "Helen had said, the New Bethel experiment had become fashionable. Taking\r\n",
      "it as their text, the women's clubs throughout the country were giving\r\n",
      "much of their time to a discussion of the changed industrial relations\r\n",
      "due to the war. Increasingly often, visitors appeared at the factory,\r\n",
      "asking if they could see for themselves--well-known, even famous figures\r\n",
      "among them. But on the afternoon when Helen Cabot made her first call,\r\n",
      "Mary received a letter which took her breath away, so distinguished, so\r\n",
      "illustrious were the names of those who were asking if they could pay a\r\n",
      "visit on the following day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary sent a telegram and then, her cheeks coloured with pride, she made a\r\n",
      "tour through the factory to make sure that everything would be in order,\r\n",
      "whispering the news here and there, and knowing that every woman would\r\n",
      "hear it as unmistakably as though it had been pealed from the heavens in\r\n",
      "tones of thunder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitors arrived at ten o'clock the next morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were four in the party--two men and two women. Mary recognized\r\n",
      "three of them at the first glance and felt a glow of pride warm her as\r\n",
      "they seated themselves in her office.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not even you,\" she thought with a glance at the attentive figures on the\r\n",
      "walls, \"not even you ever had visitors like these.\" And in some subtle\r\n",
      "manner which I simply cannot describe to you, she felt that the portrayed\r\n",
      "figures were proud of the visitors, too--and prouder yet of the\r\n",
      "dreamy-eyed girl who had brought it about, flesh of their flesh, blood of\r\n",
      "their blood, who was looking so queenly and chatting so quietly to the\r\n",
      "elect of the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fourth caller was introduced as Professor Marsh, and Mary soon\r\n",
      "perceived that he was a hostile critic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall have to be careful of him,\" she thought, \"or I shall be giving\r\n",
      "him some good, hard bouncers before I know it--and that would never do\r\n",
      "today.\" So putting the temptation behind her she presently said, \"We'll\r\n",
      "start at the nursery, if you like--any time you're ready.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You have already seen something of that nursery, its long row of windows\r\n",
      "facing the south, its awnings, toys, sand-piles and white-robed nurses.\r\n",
      "Since then Mary had had time to elaborate the original theme with a\r\n",
      "kitchen for preparing their majesties' food, linen closets and a\r\n",
      "rest-room for the nurses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chief glory of the nursery, however, was its noble line of\r\n",
      "play-rooms, each in charge of two nurses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let's look in here,\" said Mary, opening a door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They came upon an interesting scene. In this room were twelve children,\r\n",
      "about two years old. The nurses were feeding them. Each nurse sat on the\r\n",
      "inside of a kidney shaped table, large enough to accommodate six\r\n",
      "children, but low enough to avoid the necessity for high chairs with the\r\n",
      "consequent dangling between earth and heaven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In front of each child was a plate set in a recess in the table--this to\r\n",
      "guard against overturning in the excitement of the moment--and in each\r\n",
      "plate was a generous portion of chicken broth poured over broken bread.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was evidently good. Approval shone on each pink face. A brisk play of\r\n",
      "spoons and the smacking of lips seemed to be the order of the day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Each play room has its own wash room--\" said Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She opened another door belonging to this particular suite and disclosed\r\n",
      "a bathroom with special fixtures for babies. Large bowls, with hot and\r\n",
      "cold water, were set in porcelain tables.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the use of having so many bath-bowls in this table,\" asked\r\n",
      "Professor Marsh, \"when you only have two nurses to do the bathing?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Every woman with a baby has half an hour off in the morning, and another\r\n",
      "half hour in the afternoon,\" he was told. \"In the morning, she bathes her\r\n",
      "baby. In the afternoon she loves it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the next play-room which they visited, the babies were of the bottle\r\n",
      "age, and were proving this to the satisfaction of every one concerned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the next, refreshments were over; and some of the youngsters slept\r\n",
      "while others were starting large engineering projects upon the sand pile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I never saw such nurseries,\" said the most distinguished visitor. He\r\n",
      "looked at the artistic miniature furniture, the decorations, the low\r\n",
      "padded seat which ran around the walls--at once a seat and a cupboard for\r\n",
      "toys. He looked at the sunlight, the screened verandah, the awning, the\r\n",
      "flowers, the birds hopping over the lawn, the river gleaming through the\r\n",
      "trees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss Spencer,\" he said, \"I congratulate you. If they could understand\r\n",
      "me, I would congratulate these happy youngsters, too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But don't you think it's altogether wrong,\" said Professor Marsh, \"to\r\n",
      "deprive a child of the advantages of home life?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I read and hear that so often,\" said Mary, \"that I have adopted my own\r\n",
      "method of replying to it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She led her visitors into a small room with a low ceiling. It was\r\n",
      "furnished with a cookstove, a table, a small side-board, an old conch and\r\n",
      "a few chairs. The floor was splintery and only partly covered by frayed\r\n",
      "rugs and worn oil cloth. The paper on the walls was a dark mottled green.\r\n",
      "The ceiling was discoloured by smoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is the kitchen of an average wage-earner,\" said Mary. \"Some are\r\n",
      "better. Some are worse. I bought the furniture out of a room, just as it\r\n",
      "stood, and had the whole place copied in detail.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three of the visitors looked at each other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Imagine a tired woman,\" continued Mary, \"standing over that\r\n",
      "stove--perhaps expecting another baby before long. She has been washing\r\n",
      "all morning and now she is cooking. The room is damp with steam, the\r\n",
      "ceiling dotted with flies. Then imagine a child crawling around the\r\n",
      "floor, its mother too busy to attend to it, and you'll get an idea of\r\n",
      "where some of these children in the nursery would be--if they weren't\r\n",
      "here. Mind,\" she earnestly continued, \"I'm not saying that home life for\r\n",
      "poor children doesn't have its advantages, but we mustn't forget that it\r\n",
      "has its disadvantages, too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She led them next to the kindergarten.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A recess was on and the children were out in the play-ground--some\r\n",
      "swinging, some sliding down the chutes, others playing in a\r\n",
      "merry-go-round which was pushed around by hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Every other hour they have for play,\" said Mary. \"In the alternate hours\r\n",
      "the teachers read to them, talk to them, teach them their letters, teach\r\n",
      "them to sing and give them the regular kindergarten course. If they\r\n",
      "weren't here,\" she said, half turning to Professor Marsh, \"most of them\r\n",
      "would probably be playing on the street.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next place they visited was the dining room--which occupied the upper\r\n",
      "floor of one of the great buildings which Mary's father had planned. But\r\n",
      "to look at it, you would never have suspected the original purpose for\r\n",
      "which the place had been intended. It was a dining room that any hotel\r\n",
      "would be glad to call its own, with its forest-colour decorations, its\r\n",
      "growing palms and ferns on every side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The compartments around the walls are for the families,\" explained Mary.\r\n",
      "\"It is, of course, optional with those who work here whether they use the\r\n",
      "dining room or not. We supply all food at cost. This was this morning's\r\n",
      "breakfast.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bill of fare is too long to quote in full, but the visitors noted\r\n",
      "that it included a choice of fruit, choice of cereal, choice of tea,\r\n",
      "coffee, milk or cocoa--and for the main dish, either fish, ham and eggs,\r\n",
      "oyster stew or small steak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What you have seen so far,\" said Mary, \"is a side issue. Many of our\r\n",
      "workers are young women not yet married, others have some one at home to\r\n",
      "look after the children. In fact the woman with a baby or little children\r\n",
      "is in the minority, but I thought it only right to provide for them--for\r\n",
      "a number of reasons--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Including sympathy?\" smiled one of the ladies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary gave her a grateful glance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We will now have an inspection of our real work here,\" she said, \"--the\r\n",
      "same being the manufacture of bearings.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first room they entered was the ground floor of one of the buildings\r\n",
      "which housed the automatic department. At the nearer machines were long\r\n",
      "lines of women stamping out the metal discs which held the balls and\r\n",
      "rollers in their places.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When these machines were operated by men,\" said Mary, \"it required\r\n",
      "considerable strength to throw the levers. But by a very simple\r\n",
      "improvement we changed the machines so that the lightest touch on the\r\n",
      "handle is sufficient to do the work. We also put backs on the stools--and\r\n",
      "elbow rests--and racks for the feet--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They followed her glances to each of these changes but their attention\r\n",
      "soon turned to the business-like speed and precision with which each\r\n",
      "woman did her work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Women, of course, are naturally quick,\" said Mary as though reading\r\n",
      "their thoughts. \"You know what they can do on a typewriter, for\r\n",
      "instance--or on a sewing machine. As you can see, it is much simpler to\r\n",
      "operate one of these automatic machines than it is to typewrite a legal\r\n",
      "document--or make a dress.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Together they looked up the long aisle at the double line of workers in\r\n",
      "their creams and browns, their fingers deftly placing the blanks in\r\n",
      "position and removing the finished discs. Somewhere, unseen, a phonograph\r\n",
      "started playing a lively tune.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where do they get their flowers?\" asked one of the guests, noticing that\r\n",
      "each woman was wearing a rose or a carnation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They find them in their locker rooms every morning,\" said Mary. \"They\r\n",
      "usually sing when the phonograph plays,\" she added, \"but perhaps they\r\n",
      "feel nervous--at having company--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was confirmed when they left the room, for as they stood in the\r\n",
      "hallway first a hum was heard behind them here and there, and soon a\r\n",
      "mellow toned chorus arose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They certainly seem happy,\" said one of the visitors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They are,\" said Mary. \"And, indeed, why shouldn't they be? Their work is\r\n",
      "light and interesting; they are paid well; and more than anything else, I\r\n",
      "think, they all know they are making something useful--something\r\n",
      "tangible--something they can look upon with satisfaction and pride.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They ascended a stairway and suddenly the scene changed. Below, the work\r\n",
      "had been cast as though in a light staccato key, but here the music for\r\n",
      "the machinery had a more powerful note.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"These are the oscillating grinders,\" said Mary, raising her voice above\r\n",
      "the skirling symphony. \"It isn't everybody who can run them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She wondered whether her visitors caught the unconscious air of pride\r\n",
      "which many of the women wore in this department. At one end of the room a\r\n",
      "steady stream of rough castings came flowing in, while at the other end\r\n",
      "an equally steady volume of finished cones went flowing out. Mary had\r\n",
      "always liked to watch the oscillators and as she stood there, her guests\r\n",
      "temporarily forgotten, her eyes filled with the almost human movements of\r\n",
      "the whirling machines, her ears with the triumphant music of the abrasive\r\n",
      "wheels biting into the metal, that same unconscious air of pride fell\r\n",
      "upon her, too, and although she didn't know it, her glance deepened and\r\n",
      "her head went up--quite in the old Spencer manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is their work fairly accurate?\" asked one of the visitors, breaking the\r\n",
      "spell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let's go and see,\" said Mary, leading the way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cones left the grinders upon an endless conveyor which carried them\r\n",
      "to an inspection room. Here at long tables were lines of attentive women,\r\n",
      "each with a set of gauges in front of her. The visitors stopped behind\r\n",
      "one of these inspectors just as she picked up a cone to put it through\r\n",
      "its course of tests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "on a dial before her swung to \"O.K.\" Almost without stopping the motion\r\n",
      "of her hand, she inserted it into another gauge to see if it was too\r\n",
      "small. Again the pointer swung to \"O.K.\" The third test was to verify the\r\n",
      "angle of the cone, and for the third time the pointer said \"O.K.\" The\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Two,\" said the inspector.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These two unfortunates lay on a rack in front of her. Interrupting her\r\n",
      "work she picked up one of them. At the second operation the pointer\r\n",
      "turned to a red segment of the dial and a bell rang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't hear many bells ringing,\" commented the visitor, quizzically\r\n",
      "looking around the room.\r\n",

      "Mary smiled with quiet pleasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "never worked before.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She led the way to one of the tempering buildings--a building equipped\r\n",
      "with long lines of ovens--each as large as a baker's oven--where metal\r\n",
      "cones were heated instead of rolls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here, too, as you will see,\" said Mary, \"we have tried to reduce the\r\n",
      "element of human error as far as possible. In each oven is an electric\r\n",
      "thermometer and when the bearings have reached the proper degree of heat,\r\n",
      "an incandescent bulb is automatically lighted in front of the oven....\r\n",
      "See?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They made their way to the oven where a white light had appeared. A\r\n",
      "woman-worker had already opened the door and was pulling a lever. As\r\n",
      "though by magic, a bunch of castings, wired together, came travelling out\r\n",
      "of their heat bath and were immediately lowered into a large tank which\r\n",
      "held the tempering liquid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What would have happened if the oven hadn't been opened when the white\r\n",
      "light appeared?\" asked another of the visitors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In five minutes a red lamp would have been automatically lighted,\" said\r\n",
      "Mary \"--a signal for the forewoman to come and take charge of the oven.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And suppose the red lamp had been disregarded?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In five minutes more an alarm bell would have started. You would have\r\n",
      "heard it over half the factory--and it would have kept ringing until the\r\n",
      "superintendent herself had come and stopped it with a key which only she\r\n",
      "is allowed to carry.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that the bell now?\" he asked, as a mellow chime came from one of the\r\n",
      "distant buildings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" smiled Mary, listening, \"that's the lunch bell. In another ten\r\n",
      "minutes I shall have a surprise for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the end of that time, they made their way to the dining room, which\r\n",
      "was already filled with eager women. In one corner was a private room,\r\n",
      "glass-partitioned. As Mary followed her guests toward it, the full,\r\n",
      "subdued strains of the Crusader March suddenly sounded in harmonious\r\n",
      "greeting from the other end of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said the most distinguished visitor, turning to look. \"Men at\r\n",
      "last!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary let him look and then she beamed with pleasure at his glance of\r\n",
      "appreciation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Our own orchestra--one hundred pieces,\" she said. \"This is their first\r\n",
      "public appearance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, but it was a red-letter day for Mary!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether it was the way she felt, or because the sound became softened and\r\n",
      "mellowed in travelling the length of the dining room, it seemed to her\r\n",
      "that she had never heard music so sweet, had never listened to sounds\r\n",
      "that filled her heart so full or lifted her thoughts so high.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The climax came at the end of the dessert. A shy girl entered, a small\r\n",
      "leather box in her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have a souvenir for your visitor, Miss Spencer,\" she said, and turning\r\n",
      "to him she added, \"We made it with our own hands, thinking you might like\r\n",
      "to use it as a paper weight--as a reminder of what women can do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The box was lined with blue velvet and contained a small model of the\r\n",
      "Spencer bearing, made of gold, perfect to the last ball and the last\r\n",
      "roller. The visitor examined it with admiration--every eye in the dining\r\n",
      "room (which could be brought to bear) watching him through the glass\r\n",
      "partition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I ever received a more interesting souvenir,\" he said, \"I fail to\r\n",
      "recall it. Thank you, and please thank the others for me. Tell them how\r\n",
      "very much I appreciate it, and tell them, too, if you will, that here in\r\n",
      "this factory today I have had my outlook on life widened to an extent\r\n",
      "which I had thought impossible. For that, too, I thank you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course they couldn't hear him in the main room, but they could see\r\n",
      "when he had finished speaking. They clapped their hands; the band played;\r\n",
      "and when he arose and bowed, they clapped and played louder than before.\r\n",
      "And a few minutes later when the party left the dining room to the\r\n",
      "strains of El Capitan, it seemed to Mary that after the closing chord she\r\n",
      "heard two vigorous beats of the drum--soul expression of Mrs. Kelly,\r\n",
      "signifying \"That's us!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitors departed at last, and Mary returned to her office to find\r\n",
      "other callers awaiting her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first was Helen, togged to the nines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Somehow she heard they were here,\" thought Mary, \"and she came down\r\n",
      "thinking to meet them. She thought surely I would bring them in here\r\n",
      "again.\" But her next reflection made her frown a little. \"--Partly that,\r\n",
      "I guess,\" she thought, \"and partly to see Burdon, as usual.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A knock on the door interrupted her, and Joe entered, bearing two cards.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"These gentlemen have been waiting since noon,\" he announced, \"but they\r\n",
      "said they didn't mind waiting when I told them who was with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cards bore the name of a firm of public accountants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mary. \"Show them in, please, Joe. And ask Mr. Burdon if I\r\n",
      "can see him for a few minutes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you had been there, you might have noticed a change pass over Helen. A\r\n",
      "moment before Burdon's name was mentioned she was sitting relaxed and\r\n",
      "rather dispirited, as you sometimes see a yacht becalmed, riding the\r\n",
      "water without life or interest. But as soon as it appeared that Burdon\r\n",
      "was about to enter, a breeze suddenly seemed to fill Helen's sails. Her\r\n",
      "beauty, passive before, became active. Her bunting fluttered. Her flags\r\n",
      "began to fly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door opened, but Helen's smiling glance was disappointed. The two\r\n",
      "auditors entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One was grey, the other was young; but each had the same pale, incurious\r\n",
      "air of detachment. They reminded Mary of two astronomy professors of her\r\n",
      "college days, two men who had just such an air of detachment, who always\r\n",
      "seemed to be out of their element in the daylight, always waiting for the\r\n",
      "night to come to resume the study of their beloved stars.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have sent for our treasurer, Mr. Woodward,\" said Mary. \"Won't you be\r\n",
      "seated for a few minutes?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They sat down in the same impersonal way and glanced around the room with\r\n",
      "eyes that seemed to see nothing. By the side of the mantel was a framed\r\n",
      "piece of history, an itemized bill of the first generation of the firm,\r\n",
      "dated June 28, 1706, and quaint with its old spelling, its triple column\r\n",
      "of pounds, shillings and pence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"May I look at that?\" asked one of the accountants, rising. The other\r\n",
      "followed him. Their heads bent over the document.... It occurred to Mary\r\n",
      "that they were verifying the addition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the door opened and this time it was Burdon, his dashing\r\n",
      "personality immediately dominating the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary introduced the accountants to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With our new methods,\" she said, \"we probably need a new system of\r\n",
      "bookkeeping. I also want to compare our old costs with present costs--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Burdon stared at her, but Mary--half-ashamed of what she was doing--kept\r\n",
      "her glance upon the two accountants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Burdon will give you all the old records, all the old books you\r\n",
      "want,\" she said, \"and will help you in every possible way--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And still Burdon stared at her--his whole life concentrated for a moment\r\n",
      "in his glance. And still Mary looked at the two accountants who completed\r\n",
      "the triangle by looking at Burdon, as they naturally would, waiting for\r\n",
      "him to turn and speak to them. As Mary watched them, she became conscious\r\n",
      "of a change in their manner, a tenseness of interest, such as the two\r\n",
      "astronomers aforesaid might display at the sight of some disturbance in\r\n",
      "the heavens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do they see?\" she thought, and looked at Burdon. But Burdon at the\r\n",
      "same moment had turned to the accountants, his manner as large, his air\r\n",
      "as dashing as ever.\r\n",

      "Aunt Cordelia listened to her recital, their white heads nodding at the\r\n",
      "periods, their cheeks pink with pride. Now and then they exchanged\r\n",
      "glances. \"Our baby!\" these glances seemed to say, and then turned back to\r\n",
      "Mary with such love and admiration that finally the object of this\r\n",
      "pantomime could stand it no longer, but had to kiss them both till their\r\n",
      "cheeks turned pinker than ever and they gasped for breath.\r\n",

      "The accountant looked at her with the same quizzical air as an astronomer\r\n",
      "might assume in looking at a child who had just said, \"What? The sun\r\n",
      "ninety million miles away from the earth? Never!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Either that,\" he said, \"or a good many bearings were made in the factory\r\n",
      "last year--and lost in the river--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, there's some mistake,\" said Mary earnestly. \"Perhaps the factory\r\n",
      "didn't make as many bearings as you think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again he gave her his astronomical smile, as though she were saying now,\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps the moon isn't as round as you think it is; it doesn't always\r\n",
      "look round to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought it best to show you this, confidentially,\" he said, gathering\r\n",
      "the papers together, \"because we have lately become conscious of a\r\n",
      "feeling of opposition--in trying to trace the source of this discrepancy.\r\n",
      "It seems to us,\" he suggested, speaking always in his impersonal manner,\r\n",
      "\"that this is a point which needs clearing up--for the benefit of every\r\n",
      "one concerned.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mary after a pause \"Of course you must do that. It isn't\r\n",
      "right to raise suspicions and then not clear them up.... Besides,\" she\r\n",
      "added, \"I know that you'll find it's just a mistake somewhere--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After he had gone, Helen looked in, Burdon standing behind her, holding\r\n",
      "his cane horizontally, one hand near the handle, the other near the\r\n",
      "ferrule. In the half gloom of the hall he looked more dashing--more\r\n",
      "reckless--than Mary had ever visioned him. His cane might have been a\r\n",
      "sword ... his hat three-cornered with a sable feather in it....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I just looked in to say good-bye,\" said Helen. \"I'm going to take Burdon\r\n",
      "home.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I need somebody to mind me,\" said Burdon, flashing Mary one of his\r\n",
      "violent smiles; and turning to go he said to Helen over his shoulder,\r\n",
      "\"Come, child. We're late.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He calls her 'child'...\" thought Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night Wally was a visitor at the house on the hill--and when Mary\r\n",
      "saw how subdued he was--how chastened he looked--her heart went out to\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It seems so good to be here, calling again like this,\" he said. \"Does it\r\n",
      "remind you of old times, the same as it does me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary wouldn't follow him there. As they talked it occurred to her\r\n",
      "more than once that while Wally appeared to be listening to her, his\r\n",
      "thoughts were elsewhere--his ears attuned for other sounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What are you listening for!\" she asked him once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He answered her with a puzzle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For the Lorelei's song,\" he said, and going to the piano he sang it, his\r\n",
      "clear, plaintive tenor still retaining its power to make her nose smart\r\n",
      "and the dumb chills to run up and down her back. She was sitting near the\r\n",
      "piano and when he was through, he turned around on the bench.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you ever been the least bit sorry,\" he asked, \"that you turned me\r\n",
      "down--for a business career?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I didn't turn you down,\" she said. \"We couldn't agree on certain things:\r\n",
      "that's all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On what, for instance?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That love is the one great thing in life, for instance. You always said\r\n",
      "it was--especially to a girl. And I always said there were other things\r\n",
      "in a woman's life, too--that love shouldn't monopolize her any more than\r\n",
      "it does a man.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You were wrong, Mary, and you know you were wrong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was right, Wally, and you know I was right. Because, don't you\r\n",
      "see?--if love is the only thing in life, and love fails, a person's whole\r\n",
      "life is in ruins--and that isn't fair--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's true, though,\" he answered, more to himself than to her. Again he\r\n",
      "unconsciously assumed a listening attitude, as one who is trying to catch\r\n",
      "a sound from afar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wally!\" said Mary. \"What on earth are you listening for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again it pleased him to answer her with a riddle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Italian opera,\" he said; and turning back to the keyboard he began--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Woman is fickle\r\n",
      " False altogether\r\n",
      " Moves like a feather\r\n",
      " Borne on the breezes--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Did you ever sing when you were flying?\" she asked, trying to shake him\r\n",
      "out of his mood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question proved a happy one. For nearly two hours they chatted and\r\n",
      "smiled and hummed old airs together--that is to say, Wally hummed them\r\n",
      "and Mary tried, for, as you know, she couldn't sing but could only follow\r\n",
      "the melody with a sort of a deep note far down in her throat, always\r\n",
      "pretending that she wasn't doing it and shyly laughing when Wally nodded\r\n",
      "in encouragement and tried to get her to sing up louder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eleven o'clock!\" he exclaimed at last. \"That's the first time in three\r\n",
      "months--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whatever it was, he didn't finish it, but when he bade her good-bye he\r\n",
      "said in a low voice, \"Young lady, do you know that you played the very\r\n",
      "Old Ned with my life when you turned me down?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary wouldn't follow him there, either.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Wally,\" she said, and just before he went down to his car, she\r\n",
      "saw him standing on the step, his face turned toward the drive as though\r\n",
      "still listening for that distant sound--that sound which never came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The riddle was solved the next morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Helen appeared at the office soon after nine and the moment she saw Mary\r\n",
      "she said, \"Has Wally 'phoned you this morning?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her cousin looked relieved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I want you to fib for me,\" she said. \"You know the way the men stick\r\n",
      "together.... Well, the women have to do it, too.... At dinner yesterday,\"\r\n",
      "she continued, \"Wally happened to ask me where I was going that evening,\r\n",
      "and I told him I was coming over to see you. And really, dear, I meant it\r\n",
      "at the time. Instead, a little crowd of us happened to get together and\r\n",
      "we went to the club.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that was all right. But it was nearly twelve when I got home, and\r\n",
      "he looked so miserable that I hated to tell him that I had been off\r\n",
      "enjoying myself, so I pretended I had been over to see you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary blinked at the inference, but was too breathless, too alarmed to\r\n",
      "speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He asked me if I got to your house early,\" resumed Helen, \"and I said,\r\n",
      "'Oh, about eight.' And then he said, 'What time did you leave Mary's?'\r\n",
      "and I said, 'Oh, about half-past eleven.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course, I thought everything was all right, but I could tell from\r\n",
      "something he said this morning that he didn't believe me. So if he calls\r\n",
      "you up, tell him that I was over at your house last night--will\r\n",
      "you?--there's a dear--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I can't,\" said Mary, more breathless, more alarmed than ever. \"Wally\r\n",
      "was over himself last night--and, oh, Helen, now I know! He was listening\r\n",
      "for your car every minute!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Helen stared ... and then suddenly she laughed--a laugh that had no mirth\r\n",
      "in it--that sound, half bitter, half mocking, which is sometimes used as\r\n",
      "ironical applause for ironical circumstance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I guess I can square it up somehow,\" she said. \"I'll drop in and see\r\n",
      "Burdon for a few minutes.\"\r\n",

      "Before her cousin knew it, she was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll speak to her when she comes out,\" Mary told herself, but while she\r\n",
      "was trying to decide what to say, the morning mail was placed on her desk\r\n",
      "and the routine of the day began. Half an hour later she heard the sound\r\n",
      "of Helen's car rolling away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She went without saying good-bye,\" thought Mary. \"Oh, well, I'll see her\r\n",
      "again before long.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To her own surprise the events of the last few days worried her less than\r\n",
      "she expected. For one reason, she had lived long enough to notice that no\r\n",
      "matter how involved things may look, Time has an astonishing faculty of\r\n",
      "straightening them out. And for another reason, having two worries to\r\n",
      "think about, each one tended to take her mind off the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whenever she started thinking about the accountant's report, she\r\n",
      "presently found herself wondering how Helen proposed to square it up with\r\n",
      "Wally.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, well,\" she thought again, realizing the futility of trying to read\r\n",
      "the future, \"let's hope everything will come out right in the end.... It\r\n",
      "always has, so far....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Archey came in toward noon, and Mary went with him to inspect a colony of\r\n",
      "bungalows which she was having built on the heights by the side of the\r\n",
      "lake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing that she had lived long enough to notice was the different\r\n",
      "effect which different people had upon her. Although she preserved, or\r\n",
      "tried to preserve, the same tranquil air of interest toward them all--a\r\n",
      "tranquillity and interest which generally required no effort--some of the\r\n",
      "people she met in the day's work subconsciously aroused a feeling of\r\n",
      "antagonism in her, some secretly amused her, some irritated her, some\r\n",
      "made her feel under a strain, and some even had the queer, vampirish\r\n",
      "effect of leaving her washed out and listless--psychological puzzles\r\n",
      "which she had never been able to solve. But with Archey she always felt\r\n",
      "restful and contented, smiling at him and talking to him without exertion\r\n",
      "or repression and--using one of those old-fashioned phrases which are\r\n",
      "often the last word in description--always \"feeling at home\" with him,\r\n",
      "and never as though he had to be thought of as company.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They climbed the hill together and began inspecting the bungalows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wouldn't mind living in one of these myself,\" said Archey. \"What are\r\n",
      "you going to do with them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that was a secret. Mary smiled inscrutably and led the way into the\r\n",
      "kitchen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have called it a kitchen, but it was just as much a living room, a\r\n",
      "dining room. A Pullman table had been built in between two of the windows\r\n",
      "and on each side of this was a settee. At the other end of the room was a\r\n",
      "gas range. When Wally opened the refrigerator door he saw that it could\r\n",
      "be iced from the porch. Electric light fixtures hung from the ceiling and\r\n",
      "the walls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Going to have an artists' colony up here?\" teased Archey, and looking\r\n",
      "around in admiration he repeated, \"No, sir! I wouldn't mind living in one\r\n",
      "of these houses myself--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They went into the next room--the sitting room proper--unusual for its\r\n",
      "big bay window, its built-in cupboards and bookshelves. Then came the\r\n",
      "bathroom and three bed-rooms, all in true bungalow style on one floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they had first entered, Mary and Archey had chatted freely enough,\r\n",
      "but gradually they had grown quieter. There is probably no place in the\r\n",
      "world so contributive to growing intimacy as a new empty house--when\r\n",
      "viewed by a young man and a younger woman who have known each other for\r\n",
      "many years--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The place seems alive, hushed, expectant, watching every move of its\r\n",
      "visitors, breathing suggestions to them--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you like it?\" asked Mary, breaking the silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Archey nodded, afraid for the moment to trust himself to speak. They\r\n",
      "looked at each other and, almost in haste, they went outside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll never get over that trick of blushing,\" thought Mary. At the end\r\n",
      "of the hall was a closet door with a mirror set in it. She caught sight\r\n",
      "of her own cheeks. \"Oh, dear!\" she breathed to herself. \"I wonder if I'm\r\n",
      "catching it, too!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once outside, Archey began talking with the concentration of a man who is\r\n",
      "trying to put his mind on something else.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This work up here was a lucky turn for some of the strikers,\" he said.\r\n",
      "\"Things are getting slack again now and men are being laid off. Here and\r\n",
      "there I begin to hear the old grumbling, 'Three thousand women keeping\r\n",
      "three thousand men out of jobs.' So whenever I hear that, I remind them\r\n",
      "how you found work for a lot of the men up here--and then of course I\r\n",
      "tell them it was their own fault--going on strike in the first\r\n",
      "place--just to get four women discharged!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And even if three thousand women are doing the work of three thousand\r\n",
      "men,\" said Mary, \"I don't see why any one should object--if the women\r\n",
      "don't. The wages are being spent just the same to pay rent and buy food\r\n",
      "and clothes--and the savings are going into the bank--more so than when\r\n",
      "the men were drawing the money!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I guess it's a question of pride on the man's part--as much as anything\r\n",
      "else--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, Archey--don't you think a woman has pride, too?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you know what I mean. He feels he ought to be doing the work,\r\n",
      "instead of the woman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, Archey,\" she said again. \"Can't you begin to see that the average\r\n",
      "woman has always worked harder than the average man? You ask any of the\r\n",
      "women at the factory which is the easiest--the work they are doing\r\n",
      "now--or the work they used to do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I keep forgetting that. But how about this--I hear it all the time.\r\n",
      "Suppose the idea spreads and after a while there are millions of women\r\n",
      "doing work that used to be done by men--what are the men going to do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's a secret,\" she laughed. \"But I'll tell you some day--if you're\r\n",
      "good--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The friendly words slipped out unconsciously, but for some reason her\r\n",
      "tone and manner made his heart hammer away like that powerful downward\r\n",
      "passage of the Anvil Chorus. \"I'll be good,\" he managed to say.\r\n",

      "Mary hardly heard him.\r\n",

      "\"I wonder what made me speak like that,\" she was thinking. \"I must be\r\n",
      "more dignified--or he'll think I'm bold....\" And in a very dignified\r\n",
      "voice indeed, she said, \"I must be getting back now. I wish you'd find\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A few hours later, Mary was sitting in her office, thinking of this and\r\n",
      "that (as the old phrase goes) when a knock sounded on the door and the\r\n",
      "elderly accountant entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We have finished the first part of our work,\" he said, \"that dealing\r\n",

      "It was a formidable document, nearly three hundred typewritten pages,\r\n",

      "she was examining a work of art.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How he must love his work!\" she thought, and couldn't help wondering\r\n",

      "figures.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How interesting he makes it!\" she thought again. \"Why, it's almost like\r\n",
      "a novel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brilliant sentences illuminated nearly every page. \"This system,\r\n",
      "admirable in its way, is probably a legacy from the past, when the\r\n",
      "bookkeepers of Spencer & Son powdered their hair and used quill pens.--\"\r\n",
      "\"Under these conditions, a stock clerk must become a prodigy and depend\r\n",
      "upon his memory. When memory fails he must become a poet, for he has\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was still unconscious, but thanks to the surgeon his breathing was\r\n",
      "less laboured and he was resting more quietly. Mary had stayed with Helen\r\n",
      "overnight, and more than once it had occurred to her that even as it\r\n",
      "requires darkness to bring out the beauty of the stars, so in the shadow\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I know...\" thought Mary. \"It's partly because she's sorry, and partly\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "They had a day nurse, but Helen had insisted upon doing the night work\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And in the morning, to their great joy, the doctor pronounced him a\r\n",
      "little better. Mary would have stayed longer, but that was the day when\r\n",
      "the labour leaders were to visit the factory; so after hearing the\r\n",
      "physician's good report, she started for the office.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mary breathed easier, for some deep instinct told her that Wally would\r\n",
      "come through it all right. She was still smiling with satisfaction when\r\n",
      "Joe of the Plumed Hair came in with three cards, the dignity of his\r\n",
      "manner attesting to the importance of the names.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right, Joe, send them in,\" she said. \"And I wish you'd find Mr.\r\n",

      "\"This is a wonderful work you are doing here, Miss Spencer,\" said one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You think so?\" she asked. \"You mean for the women to be making\r\n",

      "\"Yes. Weren't you surprised yourself when your idea worked out so well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it wasn't my idea,\" she said. \"It was worked out in the war--oh,\r\n",
      "ever so much further than we have gone here. We are only making bearings,\r\n",
      "but when the war was on, women made rifles and cartridges and shells,\r\n",
      "cameras and lenses, telescopes, binoculars and aeroplanes. I can't begin\r\n",
      "to tell you the things they made--every part from the tiniest screws as\r\n",
      "big as the end of this pin--to rough castings. They did designing, and\r\n",
      "drafting, and moulding, and soldering, and machining, and carpentering,\r\n",
      "and electrical work--even the most unlikely things--things you would\r\n",
      "never think of--like ship-building, for instance!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ship-building! Imagine!\" she continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, one of the members of the British Board of Munitions said that if\r\n",
      "the war had lasted a few months longer, he could have guaranteed to build\r\n",
      "a battleship from keel to crow's-nest--with all its machinery and\r\n",

      "them talk for a while. The conversation turned to her last advertisement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you sure your figures are right?\" asked one. \"Are you sure your\r\n",
      "women workers are turning out bearings so much cheaper than the men did?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They are not my figures,\" she told them. \"They are taken from an audit\r\n",
      "by a firm of public accountants.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "respect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\"Perhaps you are working your women too hard.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "for yourselves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Archey was in the outer office and they took him with them. They began\r\n",

      "the tour had progressed, but in their eyes was the light of those who\r\n",
      "have seen revelations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As happy a factory as I have ever seen,\" said one. \"In fact, it makes it\r\n",

      "\"What is it you wanted to say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We wanted to talk to you about the strike. As we understand your\r\n",
      "principle, Miss Spencer, you regard it as unfair to bar a woman from any\r\n",
      "line of work which she may wish to follow--simply because she is a\r\n",
      "woman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And for the same reason, of course, no man should be debarred from\r\n",
      "working, simply because he's a man.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They smiled at that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Such being the case,\" he continued, \"I think we ought to be able to find\r\n",
      "some way of settling this strike to the satisfaction of both sides. Of\r\n",
      "course you know, Miss Spencer, that you have won the strike. But I think\r\n",
      "I can read character well enough to know that you will be as fair to the\r\n",
      "men as you wish them to be with the women.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The strike was absolutely without authority from us,\" said one of the\r\n",
      "others. \"The men will tell you that. It was a mistake. They will tell you\r\n",
      "that, too. Worse than a mistake, it was silly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"However, that's ancient history now,\" said the third. \"The present\r\n",
      "question is: How can we settle this matter to suit both sides?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I can't discharge any of the women,\" said Mary thoughtfully,\r\n",
      "\"and I don't think they want to leave--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They certainly don't look as if they did--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have another plan in mind,\" she said, more thoughtfully than before,\r\n",
      "\"but that's too uncertain yet.... The only other thing I can think of is\r\n",
      "to equip some of our empty buildings and start the men to work there.\r\n",
      "Since our new prices went into effect we have been turning business\r\n",
      "away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll do that, Miss Spencer?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course the men would have to do as much work as the women are doing\r\n",
      "now--so we could go on selling at the new prices.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You leave that to us--and to them. If there's such a thing as pride in\r\n",
      "the world, a thousand men are going to turn out as many bearings as a\r\n",
      "thousand women!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's one thing more,\" said the second; \"I notice you have raised your\r\n",
      "women's wages a dollar a day. Can we tell the men that they are going to\r\n",
      "get women's wages?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They laughed at this inversion of old ideas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You can tell them they'll get women's wages,\" said Mary, \"if they can do\r\n",
      "women's work!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in spite of her smile, for the last few minutes she had become\r\n",
      "increasingly conscious of a false note, a forced conclusion in their\r\n",
      "plans--had caught glimpses of future hostilities, misunderstandings,\r\n",
      "suspicions. The next remark of one of the labour leaders cleared her\r\n",
      "thoughts and brought her back face to face with her golden vision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The strike was silly--yes,\" one of the leaders said. \"But back of the\r\n",
      "men's actions I think I can see the question which disturbed their minds.\r\n",
      "If women enter the trades, what are the men going to do? Will there be\r\n",
      "work enough for everybody?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even before he stopped speaking, Mary knew that she had found herself,\r\n",
      "knew that the solid rock was under her feet again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is just so much useful work that has to be done in the world every\r\n",
      "day,\" she said, \"and the more hands there are to do it, the quicker it\r\n",
      "will get done.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was as far as she had ever gone before, but now she went a step\r\n",
      "farther.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us suppose, for instance, that we had three thousand married men\r\n",
      "working here eight hours a day to support their families. If now we allow\r\n",
      "three thousand women to come out of those same homes and work side by\r\n",
      "side with the men--why, don't you see?--the work could be done in four\r\n",
      "hours instead of eight, and yet the same family would receive just the\r\n",
      "same income as they are getting now--the only difference being that\r\n",
      "instead of the man drawing all the money, he would draw half and his wife\r\n",
      "would draw half.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A four hour day!\" said one of the leaders, almost in awe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure it's possible if the women help,\" said Mary, \"and\r\n",
      "I know they want to help. They want to feel that they are doing\r\n",
      "something--earning something--just the same as a man does. They want to\r\n",
      "progress--develop--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We used to think they couldn't do men's work,\" she continued. \"I used to\r\n",
      "think so, myself. So we kept them fastened up at home--something like\r\n",
      "squirrels in cages--because we thought housework was the only thing they\r\n",
      "could do....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, oh, how the war has opened our eyes!...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's nothing a man can do that a woman can't do--nothing! And now the\r\n",
      "question is: Are we going to crowd her back into her kitchen, when if we\r\n",
      "let her out we could do the world's work in four hours instead of eight?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course there are conditions where four hours wouldn't work,\" said one\r\n",
      "of the leaders half to himself. \"I can see that in many places it might\r\n",
      "be feasible, but not everywhere--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No plan works everywhere. No plan is perfect,\" said Mary earnestly.\r\n",
      "\"I've thought of that, too. The world is doing its best to progress--to\r\n",
      "make people happier--to make life more worth living all the time. But no\r\n",
      "single step will mark the end of human progress. Each step is a step:\r\n",
      "that's all...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Take the eight hour day, for instance. It doesn't apply to women at\r\n",
      "all--I mean house women. And nearly half the people are house women. It\r\n",
      "doesn't apply to farmers, either; and more than a quarter of the people\r\n",
      "in America are on farms. But you don't condemn the eight hour day--do\r\n",
      "you?--just because it doesn't fit everybody?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A four hour day!\" repeated the first leader, still speaking in tones of\r\n",
      "awe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If that wouldn't make labour happy,\" said the second, \"I don't know what\r\n",
      "would.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Myself, I'd like to see it tried out somewhere,\" said the third. \"It\r\n",
      "sounds possible--the way Miss Spencer puts it--but will it work?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's the very thing to find out,\" said Mary, \"and it won't take long.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She told them about the model bungalows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I intended to try it with twenty-five families first,\" she said, taking\r\n",
      "a list from her desk. \"Here are the names of a hundred women working\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The next morning ushered in one of those days in June which make the\r\n",
      "spirit rejoice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Mary left Helen's, she thought she had never known the sky so blue,\r\n",
      "the world so fair, the air so full of the breath of life, the song of\r\n",
      "birds, the scent of flowers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wally was definitely out of danger and Helen was nursing him back to\r\n",
      "strength like a ministering angel, every touch a caress, every glance a\r\n",
      "look of love.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now if Burdon will only leave her alone,\" thought Mary as she turned the\r\n",
      "car toward the factory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She needn't have worried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before she had time to look at her mail, Joe announced that the two\r\n",
      "accountants were waiting to see her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They've been hanging around for the last half hour,\" he confidentially\r\n",
      "added. \"I guess they want to catch a train or something.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right, Joe,\" she nodded. \"Show them in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They entered, and for the first time since she had known them, Mary\r\n",
      "thought she saw a trace of excitement in their manner--such, for\r\n",
      "instance, as you might expect to see in two learned astronomers who had\r\n",
      "seen Sirius the dog-star rushing over the heavens in pursuit of the Big\r\n",
      "Bear--or the Virgin seating herself in Cassiopeia's Chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We finished our report last night,\" said the elder, handing her a copy.\r\n",
      "\"As you will see, we have discovered a very serious situation in the\r\n",
      "treasurer's department.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It struck Mary later that she showed no surprise. Indeed, more than once\r\n",
      "in the last few days, when noticing Burdon's nervous recklessness, she\r\n",
      "had found herself connecting it with the auditors' work upon the books.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I would have asked Mr. Woodward for an explanation,\" continued the\r\n",
      "accountant, \"but he has been absent yesterday and today. However, as you\r\n",
      "will see, no explanation can possibly cover the facts disclosed. There is\r\n",
      "a clear case for criminal action against him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think there will be any action,\" said Mary, looking up after a\r\n",
      "pause. \"I'm sure his father will make good the shortage.\" But when she\r\n",
      "looked at the total she couldn't help thinking, \"It will be a tight\r\n",
      "squeeze, though, even for Uncle Stanley.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now that it was over, she felt relieved, as though a load had lifted from\r\n",
      "her mind. \"He'll never bother Helen again,\" she found herself thinking.\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps I had better telephone Judge Cutler and let him handle it--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The judge promised to be down at once, and Mary turned to her mail. Near\r\n",
      "the bottom she found a letter addressed in Burdon's writing. It was\r\n",
      "unstamped and had evidently been left at the office. The date-line simply\r\n",
      "said \"Midnight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a long letter, some of it clear enough and some of it obscure.\r\n",
      "Mary was puzzling over it when Judge Cutler and Hutchins entered. As far\r\n",
      "as she could remember, it was the first time that the butler had ever\r\n",
      "appeared at the factory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Anything wrong?\" she asked in alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He was in my office when you telephoned,\" said the judge. \"I'll let him\r\n",
      "tell his story as he told it to me.... I think I ought to ask you\r\n",
      "something first, though.... Did any one ever tell you that you had a\r\n",
      "brother Paul? ...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mary, her heart contracting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Throughout the recital she sat breathless. Now and then the colour rose\r\n",
      "to her cheeks, and more than once the tears came to her eyes, especially\r\n",
      "when Hutchins' voice broke, and when he said in tones of pride, \"Before\r\n",
      "we could stop him, Master Paul was over the rail and in the water--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "More than once Mary looked away to hide her emotion, glancing around the\r\n",
      "room at her forebears who had never seemed so attentive as then. \"You may\r\n",
      "well listen,\" thought Mary. \"He may have been the black sheep of the\r\n",
      "family, but you see what he did in the end....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hutchins told them about the search which he and Archey had made up and\r\n",
      "down the banks, aided with a flashlight, climbing, calling, and sometimes\r\n",
      "all but falling in the stream themselves. \"But it was no use, Miss Mary,\"\r\n",
      "he concluded. \"Master Paul is past all finding, I'm afraid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a long time Mary sat silent, her handkerchief to her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Archey is still looking,\" said the judge, rising. \"I'll start another\r\n",
      "searching party at once. And telephone the towns below, too. We are bound\r\n",
      "to find him if we keep on looking, you know--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They found him sooner than they expected, in the grassy basin at the bend\r\n",
      "of the river, where the high water of the night before had borne him--in\r\n",
      "the place where he had loved to dream his dreams of youth and adventure\r\n",
      "when life was young and the future full of promise. He was lying on his\r\n",
      "side, his head on his arm, his face turned to the whispering river, and\r\n",
      "there perhaps he was dreaming again--those eternal dreams which only\r\n",
      "those who have gone to their rest can know.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Time, quickly passing, brought Mary to another wonderful morning in the\r\n",
      "Story of her life. Even as her father's death had broadened her outlook,\r\n",
      "so now Paul's heroism gave her a deeper glance at the future, a more\r\n",
      "tolerant view of the past.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the morning in question, Helen brought Wally to the office. He was now\r\n",
      "entirely recovered, but Helen still mothered him, every touch a caress,\r\n",
      "every glance a look of love. Mary grew very thoughtful as she watched\r\n",
      "them. The next morning they were leaving for a tour of the Maine woods.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they left, an architect called.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under his arm he had a portfolio of plans for a Welfare Building which he\r\n",
      "had drawn exactly according to Mary's suggestions. As long as the idea\r\n",
      "had been a nebulous one--drawn only in fancy and coloured with nothing\r\n",
      "stronger than conversation, she had liked it immensely; but seeing now\r\n",
      "precisely how the building would look--how the space would be divided,\r\n",
      "she found herself shaking her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's my own fault,\" she said. \"You have followed out every one of my\r\n",
      "ideas--but somehow--well, I don't like it: that's all. If you'll leave\r\n",
      "these drawings, I'll think them over and call you up again in a few\r\n",
      "days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Judge Cutler's suggestion, Archey had been elected treasurer to take\r\n",
      "Burdon's place. Mary took the plans into his office and showed them to\r\n",
      "him. They were still discussing them, sitting at opposite sides of his\r\n",
      "flat-top desk, when the twelve o'clock whistle blew. A few minutes later,\r\n",
      "the four-hour workers passed through the gate, the men walking with their\r\n",
      "wives, the children playing between.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wonder how it's going to turn out,\" said Archey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wonder ...\" said Mary. \"Of course it's too early to tell yet. I don't\r\n",
      "know.... Time will tell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was the only solution,\" he told her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wonder ...\" she mused again. \"Anyhow it was something definite. If\r\n",
      "women are really going to take up men's trades, it's only right that they\r\n",
      "should know what it means. As long as we just keep talking on general\r\n",
      "lines about a thing, we can make it sound as nice as we like. But when we\r\n",
      "try to put theory into practice ... it doesn't always seem the same.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Take these plans, for instance,\" she ruefully remarked. \"I thought I\r\n",
      "knew exactly what I wanted. But now that I see it drawn out to scale, I\r\n",
      "don't like it. And that, perhaps, is what we've been doing here in the\r\n",
      "factory. We have taken a view of woman's possible future and we have\r\n",
      "drawn it out to scale. Everybody can see what it looks like now--they can\r\n",
      "think about it--and talk about it--and then they can decide whether they\r\n",
      "want it or not....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He caught a note in her voice that had a touch of emptiness in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you know what I would do if I were you?\" he gently asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked at him, his eyes eager with sympathy, his smile tender and\r\n",
      "touched with an admiration so deep that it might be called devotion.\r\n",
      "Never before had Archey seemed so restful to her--never before with him\r\n",
      "had she felt so much at home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I smile at him, he'll blush,\" she caught herself thinking--and\r\n",
      "experienced a rising sense of elation at the thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What would you do!\" she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'd go away for a few weeks.... I believe the change would do you good.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She smiled at him and watched his responding colour with satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If Vera was right,\" she thought, \"that's Chapter One the way he just\r\n",
      "spoke. Now next--he'll try to touch me.\"\r\n",

      "Her eyes ever so dreamy, she reached her hand over the desk and began\r\n",
      "playing with, the blotter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, he's trembling a little,\" she thought. \"And he's looking at it....\r\n",
      "But, oh, isn't he shy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She tried to hum then and lightly beat time with her hand. \"No, it isn't\r\n",

      "before--sooner or later--it becomes awfully important--\" She caught\r\n",

Whatever it was, she\\r unsteadily crossed the room, her sight blurred but her plan as steadfast\\r as ever, and a moment later she was climbing on Josiah's knee, her arms\\r tight around his neck, sobbing as though it would shake her little frame\\r to pieces.\",\n",

       "   '\"No, no,\" said Mary, \"it--it\\'s about women--\" Mac stared at her, but when\\r she added \"--about women working in the factory,\" he drew a breath of\\r relief.',\n",
       "   '\"Aye,\" he said, \"I think I can promise to keep quiet about that.\"',\n",
       "   '\"Isn\\'t it true,\" she began, \"that most of the machinery we use doesn\\'t\\r require a great deal of skill to run it?\"',\n",
       "   '\"We\\'ve a lot of automatics,\" acknowledged Mac. \"Your grandfather\\'s idea,\\r Miss Mary. A grand man. He was one of the first to make the machine think\\r instead of the operator.\"',\n",
       "   '\"How long does it take to break in an ordinary man?\"',\n",
       "   '\"A few weeks is generally enough. It depends on the man and the tool.\"',\n",
       "   'Mary told him then what she had in her mind, and Mac didn\\'t think much of\\r it until she showed him the photographs. Even then he was \"michty\\r cautious\" until he happened to turn to the picture of a munition factory\\r in Glasgow where row after row of overalled women were doing the lathe\\r work.',\n",
       "   '\"Think of that now,\" said he; \"in Glasga\\'!\" As he looked, the frost left\\r his eye. \"A grand lot of lasses,\" he said and cleared his throat.',\n",
       "   '\"If they can do it, we can do it, too--don\\'t you think so?\"',\n",
       "   '\"Why not?\" he asked. \"For let me tell you this, Miss Mary. Those old\\r countries are all grand countries--to somebody\\'s way of thinking. But\\r America is the grandest of them all, or they wouldn\\'t keep coming here as\\r fast as ships can bring them! What they can do, yes, we can do--and add\\r something for good measure, if need be!\"',\n",
       "   '\"Well, that\\'s it,\" said Mary, eagerly. \"If we go into the war, we shall\\r have to do the same as they are doing in Europe--let women do the factory\\r work. And if it comes to that, I want Spencer & Son to be ready--to be\\r the first to do it--to show the others the way!\"',\n",
       "   'Mac nodded. \"A bit of your grandfather, that,\" he thought with approval.',\n",
       "   '\"So what I want you to do,\" she concluded, \"is to make me up a list of\\r machines that women can be taught to handle the easiest, and let me have\\r it as soon as you can.\"',\n",
       "   '\"I\\'ll do that,\" he grimly nodded. \"There\\'s far too many vacant now.\"',\n",
       "   '\"And remember, please, you are not to say anything. Because, you know,\\r people would only laugh at the idea of a woman being able to do a man\\'s\\r work.\"',\n",
       "   '\"I\\'m mute,\" he nodded again, and started for the door, his mouth buttoned\\r very tightly indeed. But even while his hand was stretched out to reach\\r the knob, he paused and then returned to the desk.',\n",
       "   '\"Miss Mary,\" he said, \"I\\'m an old man, and you\\'re a young girl. I know\\r nothing, mind you, but sometimes there are funny things going on in the\\r world. And a man\\'s not a fool. What I\\'m going to tell you now, I want you\\r to remember it, but forget who told it to you. Trust nobody. Be careful.\\r I can say no more.\"',\n",
       "   '\"He means Uncle Stanley,\" thought Mary, uneasily, and a shadow fell upon\\r the day. She was still troubled when another disturbing incident arose.',\n",
       "   '\"I\\'ll leave these papers in the desk here,\" she thought, taking her keys\\r from her handbag. She unlocked the top drawer and was about to place the\\r papers on top of those which already lay there, when suddenly she paused\\r and her eyes opened wide.',\n",
       "   'On the top letter in her drawer--a grey tinted sheet--was a scattered\\r mound of cigarette ash.',\n",
       "   '\"Somebody\\'s been here--snooping,\" she thought. \"Somebody with a key to\\r the desk. He must have had a cigarette in his hand when he shut the\\r drawer, and the ashes jarred off without being noticed--\"',\n",
       "   'Irresistibly her thoughts turned to Burdon Woodward, with his gold\\r cigarette case and match box.',\n",
       "   '\"It was he who gave me the keys,\" she thought.',\n",
       "   'She sighed. A sense of walking among pitfalls took possession of her. As\\r you have probably often noticed, suspicion feeds upon suspicion, and as\\r Mary walked through the outer office she felt that more than one pair of\\r eyes were avoiding her. The old cashier kept his head buried in his\\r ledger and nearly all the men were busy with their papers and books.',\n",
       "   '\"Perhaps it\\'s because I\\'m a woman,\" she thought. Ma\\'m Maynard\\'s words\\r arose with a new significance, \"I tell you, Miss Mary, it has halways\\r been so, and it halways will. Everything that lives has its own natural\\r enemy--and a woman\\'s natural enemy: eet is man!\"',\n",
       "   'But Mary could still smile at that.',\n",
       "   '\"Take Mr. MacPherson,\" she thought; \"how is he my natural enemy? Or Judge\\r Cutler? Or Archey Forbes? Or Wally Cabot?\" She felt more normal then, but\\r when these reflections had died away, she still occasionally felt her\\r thoughts reverting to Mac\\'s warning, the cigarette ash, the averted\\r glances in the office.',\n",
       "   \"The nest morning, though, she thought she had found the answer to the\\r latter puzzle. She had hardly finished breakfast when Judge Cutler was\\r announced, his hawk's eyes frowning and never a trace of his smile.\",\n",
       "   '\"Did you get your copy of the annual report?\" he asked.',\n",
       "   '\"Not yet,\" said Mary, somehow guessing what he meant. \"Why?\"',\n",
       "   '\"I got mine in the mail this morning.\" He drew it from his pocket and his\\r frown grew deeper. \"Let\\'s go in the den,\" he said; \"we\\'ve got to talk\\r this out.\"',\n",
       "   \"It was the annual report of Spencer & Son's business and briefly stated,\\r it showed an alarming loss for the preceding twelve months.\",\n",
       "   '\"Ah-ha!\" thought Mary, \"that\\'s the reason they didn\\'t look up yesterday.\\r They had seen this, and they felt ashamed.\"',\n",
       "   '\"As nearly as I can make it out,\" said the judge, \"there\\'s too many\\r improvements going on, and not enough business. We must do something to\\r stop these big expenses, and find a way to get more bearings sold--\"',\n",
       "   'He checked himself then and looked at Mary, much as Mac had looked the\\r previous day, just before issuing his warning.',\n",
       "   '\"Perhaps he\\'s thinking of Uncle Stanley, too,\" thought Mary.',\n",
       "   '\"Another bad feature is this,\" continued the judge, \"the bank is getting\\r too strong a hold on the company. We must stop that before it gets any\\r worse.\"',\n",
       "   '\"Why?\" asked Mary, looking very innocent.',\n",
       "   '\"Because it isn\\'t good business.\"',\n",
       "   '\"But Uncle Stanley is president of the bank. You don\\'t think he\\'d do\\r anything to hurt Spencer & Son; do you?\"',\n",
       "   'The judge tapped his foot on the floor for a time, and then made a noise\\r like a groan--as though he had teeth in his mind and one of them was\\r being pulled.',\n",
       "   '\"Many a time,\" he said, \"I have tried to talk you out of your suspicions.\\r But--if it was any other man than Stanley Woodward, I would say today\\r that he was doing his best to--to--\"',\n",
       "   '\"To \\'do\\' me?\" suggested Mary, more innocent than ever.',\n",
       "   '\"Yes, my dear--to do you! And another year\\'s work like this wouldn\\'t be\\r far from having that result.\"',\n",
       "   \"Curiously enough it was Mary's great idea that comforted her. Instead of\\r feeling worried or apprehensive, she felt eager for action, her eyes\\r shining at the thoughts which came to her.\",\n",
       "   '\"All right,\" she said, \"we\\'ll have a meeting in a day or two. I\\'ll wait\\r till I get my copy of the report.\"',\n",
       "   \"Wally came that afternoon, and Mary danced with him--that is to say she\\r danced with him until a freckle-faced apprentice came up from the factory\\r with an envelope addressed in MacPherson's crabbed hand. Mary took one\\r peep inside and danced no more.\",\n",
       "   '\"If the women can pick it up as quick as the men,\" she read, \"I have\\r counted 1653 places in this factory where they could be working in a few\\r weeks time--that is, if the places were vacant. List enclosed.\\r Respectfully. James O. MacPherson.\"',\n",

       "   '\"I don\\'t think so,\" he answered. \"I told them how it started. As far as I\\r can find out, the strike here is a local affair. The men I saw disclaimed\\r any knowledge or responsibility for it.',\n",

       "   \"And all that month, and the next month, and the next, the work at Spencer\\r & Son's kept rolling out as smoothly as though it were moving on its own\\r bearings--not only the mechanical, but the welfare work as well.\",\n",
       "   'The dining room was re-modelled, as you will presently see. The band\\r progressed, as you will presently hear. The women were proud and happy in\\r the work they were doing, and Mary was proud because they were proud,\\r happy because they were happy, and all the time she was nursing another\\r secret, no one dreaming what was in her mind.',\n",
       "   'Along in the third month, Wally and Helen came back from their wedding\\r tour.

       "   '\"Who? Me?\"',\n",
       "   '\"Yes. You. Nearly everywhere we went, they began quizzing us as soon as\\r they found Miss Spencer was a cousin of mine.\"',\n",

       "   \"She was still looking out of the window in troubled meditation when the\\r arrival of the afternoon mail turned her thoughts into another track. As\\r Helen had said, the New Bethel experiment had become fashionable. Taking\\r it as their text, the women's clubs throughout the country were giving\\r much of their time to a discussion of the changed industrial relations\\r due to the war. Increasingly often, visitors appeared at the factory,\\r asking if they could see for themselves--well-known, even famous figures\\r among them. But on the afternoon when Helen Cabot made her first call,\\r Mary received a letter which took her breath away, so distinguished, so\\r illustrious were the names of those who were asking if they could pay a\\r visit on the following day.\",\n",
       "   'Mary sent a telegram and then, her cheeks coloured with pride, she made a\\r tour through the factory to make sure that everything would be in order,\\r whispering the news here and there, and knowing that every woman would\\r hear it as unmistakably as though it had been pealed from the heavens in\\r tones of thunder.',\n",

       "   'There were four in the party--two men and two women. Mary recognized\\r three of them at the first glance and felt a glow of pride warm her as\\r they seated themselves in her office.',\n",
       "   '\"Not even you,\" she thought with a glance at the attentive figures on the\\r walls, \"not even you ever had visitors like these.\" And in some subtle\\r manner which I simply cannot describe to you, she felt that the portrayed\\r figures were proud of the visitors, too--and prouder yet of the\\r dreamy-eyed girl who had brought it about, flesh of their flesh, blood of\\r their blood, who was looking so queenly and chatting so quietly to the\\r elect of the earth.',\n",
       "   'The fourth caller was introduced as Professor Marsh, and Mary soon\\r perceived that he was a hostile critic.',\n",
       "   '\"I shall have to be careful of him,\" she thought, \"or I shall be giving\\r him some good, hard bouncers before I know it--and that would never do\\r today.\" So putting the temptation behind her she presently said, \"We\\'ll\\r start at the nursery, if you like--any time you\\'re ready.\"',\n",
       "   \"You have already seen something of that nursery, its long row of windows\\r facing the south, its awnings, toys, sand-piles and white-robed nurses.\\r Since then Mary had had time to elaborate the original theme with a\\r kitchen for preparing their majesties' food, linen closets and a\\r rest-room for the nurses.\",\n",
       "   'The chief glory of the nursery, however, was its noble line of\\r play-rooms, each in charge of two nurses.',\n",
       "   '\"Let\\'s look in here,\" said Mary, opening a door.',\n",
       "   'They came upon an interesting scene. In this room were twelve children,\\r about two years old. The nurses were feeding them. Each nurse sat on the\\r inside of a kidney shaped table, large enough to accommodate six\\r children, but low enough to avoid the necessity for high chairs with the\\r consequent dangling between earth and heaven.',\n",
       "   'In front of each child was a plate set in a recess in the table--this to\\r guard against overturning in the excitement of the moment--and in each\\r plate was a generous portion of chicken broth poured over broken bread.',\n",
       "   'It was evidently good. Approval shone on each pink face. A brisk play of\\r spoons and the smacking of lips seemed to be the order of the day.',\n",
       "   '\"Each play room has its own wash room--\" said Mary.',\n",
       "   'She opened another door belonging to this particular suite and disclosed\\r a bathroom with special fixtures for babies. Large bowls, with hot and\\r cold water, were set in porcelain tables.',\n",
       "   '\"What\\'s the use of having so many bath-bowls in this table,\" asked\\r Professor Marsh, \"when you only have two nurses to do the bathing?\"',\n",
       "   '\"Every woman with a baby has half an hour off in the morning, and another\\r half hour in the afternoon,\" he was told. \"In the morning, she bathes her\\r baby. In the afternoon she loves it.\"',\n",
       "   'In the next play-room which they visited, the babies were of the bottle\\r age, and were proving this to the satisfaction of every one concerned.',\n",
       "   'In the next, refreshments were over; and some of the youngsters slept\\r while others were starting large engineering projects upon the sand pile.',\n",
       "   '\"I never saw such nurseries,\" said the most distinguished visitor. He\\r looked at the artistic miniature furniture, the decorations, the low\\r padded seat which ran around the walls--at once a seat and a cupboard for\\r toys. He looked at the sunlight, the screened verandah, the awning, the\\r flowers, the birds hopping over the lawn, the river gleaming through the\\r trees.',\n",
       "   '\"Miss Spencer,\" he said, \"I congratulate you. If they could understand\\r me, I would congratulate these happy youngsters, too.\"',\n",
       "   '\"But don\\'t you think it\\'s altogether wrong,\" said Professor Marsh, \"to\\r deprive a child of the advantages of home life?\"',\n",
       "   '\"I read and hear that so often,\" said Mary, \"that I have adopted my own\\r method of replying to it.\"',\n",
       "   'She led her visitors into a small room with a low ceiling. It was\\r furnished with a cookstove, a table, a small side-board, an old conch and\\r a few chairs. The floor was splintery and only partly covered by frayed\\r rugs and worn oil cloth. The paper on the walls was a dark mottled green.\\r The ceiling was discoloured by smoke.',\n",
       "   '\"This is the kitchen of an average wage-earner,\" said Mary. \"Some are\\r better. Some are worse. I bought the furniture out of a room, just as it\\r stood, and had the whole place copied in detail.\"',\n",
       "   'Three of the visitors looked at each other.',\n",
       "   '\"Imagine a tired woman,\" continued Mary, \"standing over that\\r stove--perhaps expecting another baby before long. She has been washing\\r all morning and now she is cooking. The room is damp with steam, the\\r ceiling dotted with flies. Then imagine a child crawling around the\\r floor, its mother too busy to attend to it, and you\\'ll get an idea of\\r where some of these children in the nursery would be--if they weren\\'t\\r here. Mind,\" she earnestly continued, \"I\\'m not saying that home life for\\r poor children doesn\\'t have its advantages, but we mustn\\'t forget that it\\r has its disadvantages, too.\"',\n",
       "   'She led them next to the kindergarten.',\n",
       "   'A recess was on and the children were out in the play-ground--some\\r swinging, some sliding down the chutes, others playing in a\\r merry-go-round which was pushed around by hand.',\n",
       "   '\"Every other hour they have for play,\" said Mary. \"In the alternate hours\\r the teachers read to them, talk to them, teach them their letters, teach\\r them to sing and give them the regular kindergarten course. If they\\r weren\\'t here,\" she said, half turning to Professor Marsh, \"most of them\\r would probably be playing on the street.\"',\n",
       "   \"The next place they visited was the dining room--which occupied the upper\\r floor of one of the great buildings which Mary's father had planned. But\\r to look at it, you would never have suspected the original purpose for\\r which the place had been intended. It was a dining room that any hotel\\r would be glad to call its own, with its forest-colour decorations, its\\r growing palms and ferns on every side.\",\n",
       "   '\"The compartments around the walls are for the families,\" explained Mary.\\r \"It is, of course, optional with those who work here whether they use the\\r dining room or not. We supply all food at cost. This was this morning\\'s\\r breakfast.\"',\n",
       "   'The bill of fare is too long to quote in full, but the visitors noted\\r that it included a choice of fruit, choice of cereal, choice of tea,\\r coffee, milk or cocoa--and for the main dish, either fish, ham and eggs,\\r oyster stew or small steak.',\n",
       "   '\"What you have seen so far,\" said Mary, \"is a side issue. Many of our\\r workers are young women not yet married, others have some one at home to\\r look after the children. In fact the woman with a baby or little children\\r is in the minority, but I thought it only right to provide for them--for\\r a number of reasons--\"',\n",
       "   '\"Including sympathy?\" smiled one of the ladies.',\n",
       "   'Mary gave her a grateful glance.',\n",
       "   '\"We will now have an inspection of our real work here,\" she said, \"--the\\r same being the manufacture of bearings.\"',\n",
       "   'The first room they entered was the ground floor of one of the buildings\\r which housed the automatic department. At the nearer machines were long\\r lines of women stamping out the metal discs which held the balls and\\r rollers in their places.',\n",
       "   '\"When these machines were operated by men,\" said Mary, \"it required\\r considerable strength to throw the levers. But by a very simple\\r improvement we changed the machines so that the lightest touch on the\\r handle is sufficient to do the work. We also put backs on the stools--and\\r elbow rests--and racks for the feet--\"',\n",
       "   'They followed her glances to each of these changes but their attention\\r soon turned to the business-like speed and precision with which each\\r woman did her work.',\n",
       "   '\"Women, of course, are naturally quick,\" said Mary as though reading\\r their thoughts. \"You know what they can do on a typewriter, for\\r instance--or on a sewing machine. As you can see, it is much simpler to\\r operate one of these automatic machines than it is to typewrite a legal\\r document--or make a dress.\"',\n",
       "   'Together they looked up the long aisle at the double line of workers in\\r their creams and browns, their fingers deftly placing the blanks in\\r position and removing the finished discs. Somewhere, unseen, a phonograph\\r started playing a lively tune.',\n",
       "   '\"Where do they get their flowers?\" asked one of the guests, noticing that\\r each woman was wearing a rose or a carnation.',\n",
       "   '\"They find them in their locker rooms every morning,\" said Mary. \"They\\r usually sing when the phonograph plays,\" she added, \"but perhaps they\\r feel nervous--at having company--\"',\n",
       "   'This was confirmed when they left the room, for as they stood in the\\r hallway first a hum was heard behind them here and there, and soon a\\r mellow toned chorus arose.',\n",
       "   '\"They certainly seem happy,\" said one of the visitors.',\n",
       "   '\"They are,\" said Mary. \"And, indeed, why shouldn\\'t they be? Their work is\\r light and interesting; they are paid well; and more than anything else, I\\r think, they all know they are making something useful--something\\r tangible--something they can look upon with satisfaction and pride.\"',\n",
       "   'They ascended a stairway and suddenly the scene changed. Below, the work\\r had been cast as though in a light staccato key, but here the music for\\r the machinery had a more powerful note.',\n",
       "   '\"These are the oscillating grinders,\" said Mary, raising her voice above\\r the skirling symphony. \"It isn\\'t everybody who can run them.\"',\n",
       "   \"She wondered whether her visitors caught the unconscious air of pride\\r which many of the women wore in this department. At one end of the room a\\r steady stream of rough castings came flowing in, while at the other end\\r an equally steady volume of finished cones went flowing out. Mary had\\r always liked to watch the oscillators and as she stood there, her guests\\r temporarily forgotten, her eyes filled with the almost human movements of\\r the whirling machines, her ears with the triumphant music of the abrasive\\r wheels biting into the metal, that same unconscious air of pride fell\\r upon her, too, and although she didn't know it, her glance deepened and\\r her head went up--quite in the old Spencer manner.\",\n",
       "   '\"Is their work fairly accurate?\" asked one of the visitors, breaking the\\r spell.',\n",
       "   '\"Let\\'s go and see,\" said Mary, leading the way.',\n",
       "   'The cones left the grinders upon an endless conveyor which carried them\\r to an inspection room. Here at long tables were lines of attentive women,\\r each with a set of gauges in front of her. The visitors stopped behind\\r one of these inspectors just as she picked up a cone to put it through\\r its course of tests.',\n",
       "   'First she slipped it into a gauge to see if it was too large. A pointer\\r on a dial before her swung to \"O.K.\" Almost without stopping the motion\\r of her hand, she inserted it into another gauge to see if it was too\\r small. Again the pointer swung to \"O.K.\" The third test was to verify the\\r angle of the cone, and for the third time the pointer said \"O.K.\" The\\r next moment the cone had been dropped into a box and another was going\\r through the same course.',\n",
       "   '\"How many have been rejected today?\" asked one of the visitors.',\n",
       "   '\"Two,\" said the inspector.',\n",
       "   'These two unfortunates lay on a rack in front of her. Interrupting her\\r work she picked up one of them. At the second operation the pointer\\r turned to a red segment of the dial and a bell rang.',\n",
       "   '\"I don\\'t hear many bells ringing,\" commented the visitor, quizzically\\r looking around the room.',\n",
       "   'Mary smiled with quiet pleasure.',\n",
       "   '\"Next,\" she said, \"I\\'m going to take you to a department where women\\r never worked before.\"',\n",
       "   \"She led the way to one of the tempering buildings--a building equipped\\r with long lines of ovens--each as large as a baker's oven--where metal\\r cones were heated instead of rolls.\",\n",
       "   '\"Here, too, as you will see,\" said Mary, \"we have tried to reduce the\\r element of human error as far as possible. In each oven is an electric\\r thermometer and when the bearings have reached the proper degree of heat,\\r an incandescent bulb is automatically lighted in front of the oven....\\r See?\"',\n",
       "   'They made their way to the oven where a white light had appeared. A\\r woman-worker had already opened the door and was pulling a lever. As\\r though by magic, a bunch of castings, wired together, came travelling out\\r of their heat bath and were immediately lowered into a large tank which\\r held the tempering liquid.',\n",
       "   '\"What would have happened if the oven hadn\\'t been opened when the white\\r light appeared?\" asked another of the visitors.',\n",
       "   '\"In five minutes a red lamp would have been automatically lighted,\" said\\r Mary \"--a signal for the forewoman to come and take charge of the oven.\"',\n",
       "   '\"And suppose the red lamp had been disregarded?\"',\n",
       "   '\"In five minutes more an alarm bell would have started. You would have\\r heard it over half the factory--and it would have kept ringing until the\\r superintendent herself had come and stopped it with a key which only she\\r is allowed to carry.\"',\n",
       "   '\"Is that the bell now?\" he asked, as a mellow chime came from one of the\\r distant buildings.',\n",
       "   '\"No,\" smiled Mary, listening, \"that\\'s the lunch bell. In another ten\\r minutes I shall have a surprise for you.\"',\n",
       "   'At the end of that time, they made their way to the dining room, which\\r was already filled with eager women. In one corner was a private room,\\r glass-partitioned. As Mary followed her guests toward it, the full,\\r subdued strains of the Crusader March suddenly sounded in harmonious\\r greeting from the other end of the room.',\n",
       "   '\"Ah!\" said the most distinguished visitor, turning to look. \"Men at\\r last!\"',\n",
       "   'Mary let him look and then she beamed with pleasure at his glance of\\r appreciation.',\n",
       "   '\"Our own orchestra--one hundred pieces,\" she said. \"This is their first\\r public appearance.\"',\n",
       "   'Oh, but it was a red-letter day for Mary!',\n",
       "   'Whether it was the way she felt, or because the sound became softened and\\r mellowed in travelling the length of the dining room, it seemed to her\\r that she had never heard music so sweet, had never listened to sounds\\r that filled her heart so full or lifted her thoughts so high.',\n",
       "   'The climax came at the end of the dessert. A shy girl entered, a small\\r leather box in her hand.',\n",
       "   '\"I have a souvenir for your visitor, Miss Spencer,\" she said, and turning\\r to him she added, \"We made it with our own hands, thinking you might like\\r to use it as a paper weight--as a reminder of what women can do.\"',\n",
       "   'The box was lined with blue velvet and contained a small model of the\\r Spencer bearing, made of gold, perfect to the last ball and the last\\r roller. The visitor examined it with admiration--every eye in the dining\\r room (which could be brought to bear) watching him through the glass\\r partition.',\n",
       "   '\"If I ever received a more interesting souvenir,\" he said, \"I fail to\\r recall it. Thank you, and please thank the others for me. Tell them how\\r very much I appreciate it, and tell them, too, if you will, that here in\\r this factory today I have had my outlook on life widened to an extent\\r which I had thought impossible. For that, too, I thank you.\"',\n",
       "   'Of course they couldn\\'t hear him in the main room, but they could see\\r when he had finished speaking. They clapped their hands; the band played;\\r and when he arose and bowed, they clapped and played louder than before.\\r And a few minutes later when the party left the dining room to the\\r strains of El Capitan, it seemed to Mary that after the closing chord she\\r heard two vigorous beats of the drum--soul expression of Mrs. Kelly,\\r signifying \"That\\'s us!\"',\n",
       "   'The visitors departed at last, and Mary returned to her office to find\\r other callers awaiting her.',\n",
       "   'The first was Helen, togged to the nines.',\n",
       "   '\"Somehow she heard they were here,\" thought Mary, \"and she came down\\r thinking to meet them.

I can\\'t begin\\r to tell you the things they made--every part from the tiniest screws as\\r big as the end of this pin--to rough castings.

       "   '\"The strike was silly--yes,\" one of the leaders said. \"But back of the\\r men\\'s actions I think I can see the question which disturbed their minds.\\r If women enter the trades, what are the men going to do? Will there be\\r work enough for everybody?\"',\n",

       "   '\"There\\'s nothing a man can do that a woman can\\'t do--nothing! And now the\\r question is: Are we going to crowd her back into her kitchen, when if we\\r let her out we could do the world\\'s work in four hours instead of eight?\"',\n",
       "   '\"Of course there are conditions where four hours wouldn\\'t work,\" said one\\r of the leaders half to himself. \"I can see that in many places it might\\r be feasible, but not everywhere--\"',\n",

       "   'He moved up a little and tried next by dropping his coat. This caught\\r fairly against the boat. Then before they knew what he was doing, he had\\r climbed over the rail of the bridge and had dropped into the swiftly\\r moving water below.',\n",

       "   \"Paul's arms were clinging around the bow of the boat. He twisted his\\r body, the current helping him, and gained the top of the tarpaulin.

       "   '\"He\\'s feeling for his knife,\" thought Archey. \"He\\'s got it!\"',\n",
       "   'Paul ran his blade around the cloth and had soon tossed the tarpaulin\\r over the dam. Then he made a gesture of helplessness. From the bridge,\\r they could see that the stern of the boat was heavily boxed in.',\n",

       "   'Archey ran to the car for a hammer, but Paul had climbed to the bow and\\r was looking at the ring in which was fastened the cable that held the\\r boat in place. The strain of the current had probably weakened this, for\\r the next thing they saw--Paul was tugging at the cable with all his\\r strength, worrying it from side to side, kicking at the bow with the\\r front of his heel, evidently trying to pull the ring from its socket.',\n",
       "   '\"If that gives way, the whole thing goes over,\" cried Archey. \"I\\'ll throw\\r him the hammer.\"',\n",
       "   'Even as he spoke the ring suddenly came out of the bow; and thrown off\\r his balance by his own effort, Paul went over the side of the boat and in\\r the same moment had disappeared from view.',\n",

       "   'The boat was lurching forward--unsteadily--unevenly--',\n",
       "   '\"Something chained to the bottom, all right,\" thought Archey, all eyes to\\r see, the hammer still in his hand. As they watched, the boat tipped\\r forward--lurched--vanished--followed quickly by two cylindrical objects\\r which, in the momentary glimpse they caught of them, had the appearance\\r of steel barrels.',\n",
